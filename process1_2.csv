Although this  case would clearly be a breach of Economic Law, the re is no applicable law in Kosovo for the  time being.     Conclusions  The entire matter has to be seen as an administrati ve irregularity. It is obvious that international  procurement rules and economic crime law had been b reached but the Procurement Regulation  that was in force at that time – Financial Agreemen t 1999/2 – does not indicate cases like  described before and Kosovo does not have yet any E conomic Law.

INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants, which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are four specific allegations in this repo rt of investigation:  • tender specifications produced by the Pristina Air port for the cargo apron  extension were insufficiently specific and without clear instructions for bidder  contrary to UNMIK Finance Regulation 1999/2;  • three persons on the bid opening committee were al so part of the technical  evaluation committee contrary to procurement regula tions;  • the contract for the cargo apron extension was not  provided to the UNMIK  Office of the Legal Adviser for clearance; and  • it is alleged that the Vendor was allowed to certi fy its work as per the  requirements of the contract.      II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates, “Staff members shall uphold the highes t  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds  provides that:  Article 4 1  – “Competition among and participation in the proc urement process  shall be maximised.”  2  Article 4.1.1  – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders  shall be treated  fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each  Tender shall be judged on its merits.”  Article 4.3.3 . – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or e mployee of such  consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of  the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering  for a contract, including  but not limited to preparations of specifications o r any other Tender Documents,  no such consultant nor any principal officer or emp loyee of such consultant, no  “related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender  for or sponsor or participate in  the Tendering for such contract.”  Article 23.3  – “All tender documents shall contain complete inf ormation in neutral  and objective terms so that there can be full and f air competition among all  suppliers.

METHODOLOGY     3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.    IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised DOTI Official 1 (Department  of Transport and Infrastructure). The DOTI was late r known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs. DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  3  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the  armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer 1,  Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and lat er by a consultant from the  Consulting Company.    6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed. Under him were the PEAP Offi cial and ATCS Official  (Air Traffic Control Services).    7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.      V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     9. This part of the investigation relates to a tend er for a contract for the extension of  the Cargo Terminal Apron at Pristina Airport. The v alue of the contract was  €774,318.63.  Allegation 1     (Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo a pron did not comply with the  requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance A dministrative Instruction 1999/2  on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Bud get Funds, as they were  based on summary documents and did not include clea r instructions on drawings  and plans.)    10. A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluat ion Company to the PEAP  Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the  Evaluation Company was  commissioned to produce a preliminary design for th e Cargo Terminal at Pristina  Airport. The design also provided for the construct ion of the Cargo Apron  Extension.     11. A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five  companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the  Cargo Apron Extension. Four  companies submitted bids, and following an evaluati on, the contract was  awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for th e Cargo Apron Extension on  11 September 2001.    12. A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP date d 9 May 2001 indicates that it  submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include  what appears to be a section from the preliminary d esign documents produced by  the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a  section entitled ”Bills of  Quantities” from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design  documents.    4  13. An interoffice memorandum providing an “outstan ding issues update to Official  2”, from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the o ffice of Official 2 dated 18 May  2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers  were provided by companies  on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance.  However, a more likely explanation is the date of t he interoffice memorandum  has been incorrectly dated, since the document cont ains reference dates relating  to project “events” which post date 18 May 2001. At  paragraph 2b, the interoffice  memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation t o tender was based on  summary documents.     14. At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension eva luation report dated 2 August  2001, the committee notes that the bidding document s did not include clear  instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was  recommended that  negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Ve ndor, on further details of the  scope of works.    15. In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not  comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Admin istrative Instruction 1999/2  on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Bud get Funds.    16. When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied  with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Fi nance Administrative  Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget  Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer  was asked this question,  he/she would indicate that the tender specification s were technically deficient and  did not comply with Article 23.3.    17. DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical de tails of the Cargo Apron extension  project were taken from the cargo terminal study pr oduced by the Evaluation  Company and pasted into the tender document specifi cations. Thereafter, it was  up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate  that they could fulfil the  specification.    18. According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the  tender had been launched, had been angry with the E valuation Company for  allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of th eir study as the tender  specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also express ed concern at the method  used for preparing the tender documents, as from an  engineering point of view  the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. Howe ver, DOTI Official 2 stated that if  the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare th e tender documents, it  would have cost more money. He/she had therefore pr epared the tender  documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procur ement Official at the CPE to  review and help him with the procurement exercise.    19. Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer,  and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official,  as to the procurement  documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expre ssed the view that neither  the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Of ficer would have had the  technical expertise or time to review the technical  specifications.    5  20. DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no en gineering expert to support  his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a  fact that made his/her work  very difficult.    Allegations 2 & 3    (Specifically, three of the persons on the bid open ing committee and evaluation  committees were the same parties who should not hav e carried out both tasks.)    and     (The contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not  channelled through the Office  of the Legal Adviser.)       21. The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is si gned by three parties, who are  also listed as having attended the bid opening sess ion. This indicates that the  composition of the bid opening committee and the ev aluation committee  overlapped.    22. When asked about this issue in interview DOTI O fficial 2 confirmed that he/she  was both on the bid opening committee and was a mem ber of the evaluation  committee. He/she added that the people who evaluat ed the offers signed the  evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regu lations, which segregate the two  roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September  2001 indicates that the  contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been  channelled through the  Office of the Legal Adviser.     Allegation 4    (Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own tes t results to confirm the quality of its  own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflic t of interest.)    23. An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 t o the Procurement Official,  signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, in dicates that DOTI Official 1  authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memoran dum also adds that the work  was inadvertently not included in the original cont ract.    24. DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to p rogress the cargo apron tender,  he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/sh e added that only after the  tests were done could the tender go ahead. However,  the evaluation report at  paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature  of the ground does not  appear to have been included in the tender document s. In addition, a letter from  the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, bu t apparently not  received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, a ccording to a manuscript  note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it  carried out its own soil tests.     25. A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 Septe mber 2003 suggests that the  Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity repor t for the Cargo Apron,  thereby “self certifying” its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5,  6  reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay l iquidated damages in the event  that the “load-bearing “ capacity of the apron is l ess than foreseen in the contract,  upon completion of the work, the contract is silent  as to whom should carry out  the tests. However, it is questionable as to whethe r the Vendor should have  carried it out, since it presents a conflict of int erest.     26.  When asked about this in interview, the Divisi onal Manager stated:  “Without seeing any other documents, on the face of  it, it does appear that there  could be a conflict of interest here. But the repor t was produced by a professional  pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree  of integrity.”  27.  The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated  that he/she was unhappy about  the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she comm ented that the airport  engineer should have questioned it.    28. The ITF does not have sufficient technical know ledge to assess the adequacy of  the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divis ional Manager to Staff  Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the pos sibility that it was not up to  specification in certain areas.     VI. CONCLUSIONS     29. Evidence indicates that the tender documents fo r the cargo apron did not comply  with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative  Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget  Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear  instructions on drawings and plans. This appears to  have been due to an attempt  to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately  qualified staff.    30. In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender doc uments also appears to have been  due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the  tender documents rather than a deliberate act calcu lated to manipulate the tender  process.    31. DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for th e shortcomings in the tender  documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE mus t also bear a certain  amount of responsibility.    32. The shortcomings in the tender documents are li kely to have prejudiced some  companies in their decision as to submitting bids f or the tenders, since they may  not have been clear as to the detailed requirements  of the tender and therefore  submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a re sult.     33. Three persons are indicated to have both attend ed the bid opening session as  well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in  conflict with UN regulations.    34. Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo A pron Extension was not  channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.     7  35. Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its  own bearing capacity report for  the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work and presenting a potential  conflict of interest.     VII. RECOMMENDATIONS    36. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that all co ntracts are referred for legal  advice before signature in order to reduce potentia l liability issues and avoid a  recurrence of the problems of this instant case. (I V04/282/01)  37. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that staff understand and comply with the  requirements of the UNMIK Public Procurement Regula tion No 2004/3.  (IV04/282/02)  38. It is recommended that UNMIK ensures that all w ork conducted under contract, in  which the final product has to be evaluated, that s aid the evaluation be carried  out by a suitably qualified, independent entity. (I V04/282/03)    39. It is recommended that DPKO take appropriate ac tion with respect to DOTI  Official 2 (currently serving with MONUC).

Under him were the PEAP Offi cial and ATCS Official (Air Traffic Control Services). 7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations. 8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined. V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS 9. This part of the investigation relates to a tend er for a contract for the extension of the Cargo Terminal Apron at Pristina Airport. The v alue of the contract was €774,318.63. Allegation 1 (Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo a pron did not comply with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance A dministrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Bud get Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clea r instructions on drawings and plans.) 10. A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluat ion Company to the PEAP Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the Evaluation Company was commissioned to produce a preliminary design for th e Cargo Terminal at Pristina Airport. The design also provided for the construct ion of the Cargo Apron Extension. 11. A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the Cargo Apron Extension. Four companies submitted bids, and following an evaluati on, the contract was awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for th e Cargo Apron Extension on 11 September 2001. 12. A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP date d 9 May 2001 indicates that it submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include what appears to be a section from the preliminary d esign documents produced by the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a section entitled ”Bills of Quantities” from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design documents. 4 13. An interoffice memorandum providing an “outstan ding issues update to Official 2”, from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the o ffice of Official 2 dated 18 May 2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance. However, a more likely explanation is the date of t he interoffice memorandum has been incorrectly dated, since the document cont ains reference dates relating to project “events” which post date 18 May 2001. At paragraph 2b, the interoffice memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation t o tender was based on summary documents. 14. At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension eva luation report dated 2 August 2001, the committee notes that the bidding document s did not include clear instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was recommended that negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Ve ndor, on further details of the scope of works. 15. In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Admin istrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Bud get Funds. 16. When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Fi nance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question, he/she would indicate that the tender specification s were technically deficient and did not comply with Article 23.3. 17. DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical de tails of the Cargo Apron extension project were taken from the cargo terminal study pr oduced by the Evaluation Company and pasted into the tender document specifi cations. Thereafter, it was up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the specification. 18. According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the tender had been launched, had been angry with the E valuation Company for allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of th eir study as the tender specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also express ed concern at the method used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. Howe ver, DOTI Official 2 stated that if the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare th e tender documents, it would have cost more money. He/she had therefore pr epared the tender documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procur ement Official at the CPE to review and help him with the procurement exercise. 19. Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer, and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expre ssed the view that neither the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Of ficer would have had the technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications. 5 20. DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no en gineering expert to support his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work very difficult. Allegations 2 & 3 (Specifically, three of the persons on the bid open ing committee and evaluation committees were the same parties who should not hav e carried out both tasks.) and (The contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.) 21. The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is si gned by three parties, who are also listed as having attended the bid opening sess ion. This indicates that the composition of the bid opening committee and the ev aluation committee overlapped. 22. When asked about this issue in interview DOTI O fficial 2 confirmed that he/she was both on the bid opening committee and was a mem ber of the evaluation committee. He/she added that the people who evaluat ed the offers signed the evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regu lations, which segregate the two roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September 2001 indicates that the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser. Allegation 4 (Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own tes t results to confirm the quality of its own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflic t of interest.) 23. An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 t o the Procurement Official, signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, in dicates that DOTI Official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memoran dum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original cont ract. 24. DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to p rogress the cargo apron tender, he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/sh e added that only after the tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not appear to have been included in the tender document s. In addition, a letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, bu t apparently not received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, a ccording to a manuscript note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it carried out its own soil tests. 25. A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 Septe mber 2003 suggests that the Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity repor t for the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5, 6 reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay l iquidated damages in the event that the “load-bearing “ capacity of the apron is l ess than foreseen in the contract, upon completion of the work, the contract is silent as to whom should carry out the tests. However, it is questionable as to whethe r the Vendor should have carried it out, since it presents a conflict of int erest. 26. When asked about this in interview, the Divisi onal Manager stated: “Without seeing any other documents, on the face of it, it does appear that there could be a conflict of interest here. But the repor t was produced by a professional pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree of integrity.” 27. The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated that he/she was unhappy about the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she comm ented that the airport engineer should have questioned it. 28. The ITF does not have sufficient technical know ledge to assess the adequacy of the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divis ional Manager to Staff Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the pos sibility that it was not up to specification in certain areas. VI. CONCLUSIONS 29. Evidence indicates that the tender documents fo r the cargo apron did not comply with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings and plans. This appears to have been due to an attempt to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately qualified staff. 30. In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender doc uments also appears to have been due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the tender documents rather than a deliberate act calcu lated to manipulate the tender process. 31. DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for th e shortcomings in the tender documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE mus t also bear a certain amount of responsibility. 32. The shortcomings in the tender documents are li kely to have prejudiced some companies in their decision as to submitting bids f or the tenders, since they may not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a re sult. 33. Three persons are indicated to have both attend ed the bid opening session as well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations. 34. Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo A pron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser. 7 35. Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work and presenting a potential conflict of interest. VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 36. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that all co ntracts are referred for legal advice before signature in order to reduce potentia l liability issues and avoid a recurrence of the problems of this instant case. (I V04/282/01) 37. It is recommended that UNMIK ensure that staff understand and comply with the requirements of the UNMIK Public Procurement Regula tion No 2004/3. (IV04/282/02) 38. It is recommended that UNMIK ensures that all w ork conducted under contract, in which the final product has to be evaluated, that s aid the evaluation be carried out by a suitably qualified, independent entity. (I V04/282/03) 39. It is recommended that DPKO take appropriate ac tion with respect to DOTI Official 2 (currently serving with MONUC).

Fatih Birol, Chief Economist of the IEA, reportedly warned the Japanese in mid­May that they are pushing too hard to promote the sectoral approach and may be perceived as offering this approach as the only option for reducing carbon emissions. He also cautioned that the sectoral approach is not yet understood and that Tokyo must clarify the concept and promote understanding and trust among the nations concerned.

11.pdf,"UNITED NATIONS   United Nations Interim  Administration Mission in Kosovo      UNMIK NATIONS UNIES  Mission d’Administration Intérimaire  des Nations Unies au Kosovo   Investigation Task Force      Allegations of theft and corruption arising out of the collection of handling and  landing fees and de-icing costs for passenger aircr aft using Pristina Airport.  (Case 0283/04)      I. INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants which led to an investigation concernin g alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are three specific allegations in this rep ort of investigation:  • Employees overcharged commercial flights using Pri stina Airport for handling and  landing fees and other services.  • Employees failed to account for the money paid to them in handling and landing  fees and other services.  • Employees requested and /or received corrupt payme nts in return for allocating  landing slots to airlines at the most convenient ti mes.      II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest   standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct . “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her  obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and the  Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuan ces, or to observe the standards of  conduct expected of an international civil servant,  may amount to unsatisfactory  conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of  disciplinary measures for misconduct.”          2      III. METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.    4. This report details the findings resulting from these enquiries.      IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    5. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999,  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    6. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport  and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs.  DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the  armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer I,  Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and late r by the Consultant from the  Consulting Firm.    7. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under him  were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official.    8. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    9. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.    3    V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     10. This case concerns allegations of corruption by  staff at Pristina Airport arising  from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in  the period January – December 2001. The case also d eals with allegations of  corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on pa ssenger aircraft using the  Airport during the same period and alleged requests  for corrupt payments for the  allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most  convenient times.    11. Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in  2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact th at fees appear to have been  collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater  risk of fraudulent activity existed.    12. Where possible, similar dates and the type of a ircraft were selected to allow for a  comparative analysis of landing charges and passeng er charges.    13. An average price was then calculated for each t ype of aircraft by selecting a  sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give  an estimate of the total income from landing fees.    14. The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication  as to the respective costs for basic airport servic es, based on the weight of the  aircraft.     Handling Fees and De-icing costs    15. The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949  (equivalent to €7,341,163. This compares with a fig ure of €7,376,182 in the profit  and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Account ants.     16. This result suggests that in the absence of fur ther information, the aircraft  charges agreed with the figures produced in the off icial accounts of the Airport.  However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot  be verified. The possibility therefore remains that  airlines were routinely  overcharged.    17. It was noted that there are small variations in  the prices charged to different  airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, ce rtain airlines appeared to have  measurably lower costs. These were:  • Airline 1 – Average DM 2190  • Airline 2 – Average DM 2888.    18. The receipts books do not indicate whether Airl ine 1 carried passengers and if so,  how many.     19. It was notable that where aircraft requested de -icing facilities, this appears to  have added considerably to the landing fees costs.     20. A schedule was created detailing costs associat ed with de-icing. With the  possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this do es not appear to indicate any     4      obvious anomalies, although it again did not take i nto account the possibility that  airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-ic ing.      Landing Fees    21. Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM p er passenger. A spreadsheet  was created detailing the total number of persons t ravelling in the period 1  February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not  paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January  2001.    22. The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a  total of 375,472 passengers  during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not  pay the required passenger  tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and conv erted to Euro per paying  passenger, this gives a total of €4,799,395 as agai nst a stated income figure in  the accounts of €4,919,190 for the whole year. This  gap is diminished if a number  of passengers were to be added for the month of Jan uary 2001.    23. However, there remains a possibility that the p assengers were not being charged  airport tax when they should have been, or that the  sums detailed in the accounts  do not equate with sums actually paid.    24. In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for  handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the IT F sent a request to IATA to  provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airl ine 5 and Airline 6 concerning any  instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The  request also sought information concerning any inst ances of corruption arising  from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Ai rport.    25. Regrettably, to date, no substantive response h as been received from the airlines  or IATA.      VI. CONCLUSIONS     26. Whilst the figures for handling and landing fee s broadly agree with the figures  produced in the accounts of the Airport, it is not possible to ascertain whether the  source of information forming the basis of the acco unts is reliable.    27. In the absence of cooperation from the Airlines  and IATA, despite repeated  requests by the ITF, it is not possible to progress  the case further.      VII. RECOMMENDATIONS    28. It is therefore recommended that based on the r esults of this investigation,  UNMIK should prepare an official request to the abo ve-mentioned airlines in an  effort to obtain their support and any information relevant to this matter.

This report summarizes the investigation into a report supplied to the Investigation Task  Force (ITF) alleging that “kickbacks” had been paid  to an airport official in order to obtain  employment at Pristina Airport. The allegations wer e contained in a confidential police  report written by Kosovo Police Service Officer 1 ( KPS) serving in the Pristina Airport  Border Police, but originated from Non Staff member  1. The allegations specifically stated  that Non Staff member 1, and others, paid kickbacks  to certain high-ranking Pristina Airport  employees in the hope of receiving employment.  II - Background   2.  As this case was referred to the Department of Just ice on 24 September 2004 and is  currently under two separate judicial investigation s, the ITF did not continue with its  administrative investigations. This report summariz es the activities of the ITF. It should  also be noted that dissemination of this report sho uld be severely restricted given the  ongoing criminal inquiries.  III - Investigative Details   3. A separate case - ITF Case No. 2l5/04 - relating  to requests for sexual favours in return for  employment had already been under investigation whe n this report was received. Case No.  215-04 was subsequently closed due to the problem t hat none of the “victims"" were willing  to come forward and file an official statement on t he matter. The reasons given to the ITF for  this fear of making a report was related to the thr eat of losing already obtained employment  at the airport, or to jeopardize marriages and repu tations.  4. Non Staff member 1’s statements provided to the ITF Investigators, disclosed the following  two distinct cases:  Case A   5. On 25-26 July 2004, Non Staff member 1 alleges t o have visited Official 1 (Pristina Airport)  asking how he/she could obtain employment at Pristi na Airport. He/she stated that Official 1  2 had replied that this was possible, but only via th e payment of a considerable amount of  money.  6. Non Staff member 1 was aware that two other pers ons, Non Staff member 2 and Non Staff  member 3 had already paid €7,000.00 each, to Offici al 1 through the same procedure, in the  hope of receiving employment at Pristina Airport.  7. On either 30 or 31 July 2004, Non Staff member 1  said he/she was contacted by Official 1’s  daughter, Official 2’s Secretary, requesting him/he r to come to Restaurant 1 located in  Hajvali.  8. Non Staff member 1 stated that he/she was person ally greeted upon his arrival by Security  Official, Official 2’s Secretary and Official 1 and  another person, male, but name unknown,  who was there seeking a similar employment route.  9. According to Non Staff member 1, the other perso n paid, in his presence, the sum of  €10.000,00 to Official 2’s Secretary, just before N on Staff member 1 himself/herself handed  €5.000,00 to the same person.  10. After both persons had paid the agreed upon cas h amounts, they were both requested to sign  three different coloured books entitled “Airport St aff”, and then asked to leave because they  would be contacted by telephone as to the details o f their future employment at Pristina  Airport.  11. Non Staff member 1 told the ITF that he/she was  called again, two days later, in order to pay  an additional € 1.000,00, which he/she had then giv en to Official 2’s Secretary, in the  presence of his/her father, Official 1, during a di nner that Official 1 and his daughter were  having at the same mentioned restaurant. Non Staff member 1 also said that he/she paid  approximately € 180 for that night’s dinner and tha t he/she was called, always by Official 2’s  Secretary, to two further dinners at Restaurant 2 a nd at Restaurant 1.  Non-Staff member 1  was requested to pay, amounts of € 225 and € 190 fo r the dinners. Non Staff member 1 stated  that during the dinner, the following Pristina Airp ort staff were present: Security Official, a  Secretary, Official 2, X-Ray Official, Official 1, Official 2’s Secretary, Official 3, Official 4  and one person who only spoke English (name unknown ). This person may have been  Official 5, because Non Staff member 1 stated that this person was not a Kosovar, but an  International and furthermore, at a certain point w hen this person was not present, all the  others congratulated Non Staff member 1 for his new  job. The Investigators believe that the  above-mentioned Airport staff were attempting to de monstrate to Non Staff member 1 that  they were in contact with the competent person who could authorize his employment.  Case-B  12. Non Staff member 1 stated that he/she was aware  of another case of kickbacks for Pristina  Airport employment, which occurred circa 6 Septembe r 2004. Non Staff member 1, in his  role as the owner of a hamburger/sandwich stand/res taurant - well-frequented by airport  employees – said he/she was contacted by KPS office r 2 who requested information in  relation to what business connections Non Staff mem ber 4 had within Pristina Airport.  3 13.  Non Staff member 1 stated that Non Staff member 5, the wife of KPS Officer 2 met Non  Staff member 4 in the clothing boutique where he/sh e worked, while he/she was  purchasing airport uniforms. At that time, he/she h ad asked him/her how to obtain a job  at the airport. He/she allegedly replied he/she had  no problems in getting him/her a job at  Pristina Airport due to his/her important airport c ontacts, but it would cost him/her €  3.000,00.  V – Conclusion   14. As ITF referred this case to the Department of Justice on 24 September 2004, no further  action was taken by ITF. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn at this stage on the basis of  ITF Investigations.  V - Recommendations   15. The ITF offers the following recommendations:  Recommendation No. 1 : Due to the fact that this case has already been r eferred to the  International Prosecutor and is currently being inv estigated by the  Financial Investigation Unit, the ITF recommends th at UNMIK  Pillar IV take no administrative action against Air port staff until  the/ judicial process is finalized (IV04/377/01);   Recommendation No. 2 : Should the Airport staff not be criminally charge d by the  Department of Justice, ITF recommends that UNMIK Pil lar IV  should consider appropriate administrative action a gainst  implicated Pristina Airport staff in the light of t he Department of  Justice’s findings (IV04/377/02).","1 UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE Allegations of Bribes/Kickbacks for Employment at Pristina Airport (Case No. 377/04) I - Allegations 1.

On 25-26 July 2004, Non Staff member 1 alleges t o have visited Official 1 (Pristina Airport) asking how he/she could obtain employment at Pristi na Airport. He/she stated that Official 1 2 had replied that this was possible, but only via th e payment of a considerable amount of money. 6. Non Staff member 1 was aware that two other pers ons, Non Staff member 2 and Non Staff member 3 had already paid €7,000.00 each, to Offici al 1 through the same procedure, in the hope of receiving employment at Pristina Airport. 7. On either 30 or 31 July 2004, Non Staff member 1 said he/she was contacted by Official 1’s daughter, Official 2’s Secretary, requesting him/he r to come to Restaurant 1 located in Hajvali. 8. Non Staff member 1 stated that he/she was person ally greeted upon his arrival by Security Official, Official 2’s Secretary and Official 1 and another person, male, but name unknown, who was there seeking a similar employment route. 9. According to Non Staff member 1, the other perso n paid, in his presence, the sum of €10.000,00 to Official 2’s Secretary, just before N on Staff member 1 himself/herself handed €5.000,00 to the same person. 10. After both persons had paid the agreed upon cas h amounts, they were both requested to sign three different coloured books entitled “Airport St aff”, and then asked to leave because they would be contacted by telephone as to the details o f their future employment at Pristina Airport. 11. Non Staff member 1 told the ITF that he/she was called again, two days later, in order to pay an additional € 1.000,00, which he/she had then giv en to Official 2’s Secretary, in the presence of his/her father, Official 1, during a di nner that Official 1 and his daughter were having at the same mentioned restaurant. Non Staff member 1 also said that he/she paid approximately € 180 for that night’s dinner and tha t he/she was called, always by Official 2’s Secretary, to two further dinners at Restaurant 2 a nd at Restaurant 1. Non-Staff member 1 was requested to pay, amounts of € 225 and € 190 fo r the dinners. Non Staff member 1 stated that during the dinner, the following Pristina Airp ort staff were present: Security Official, a Secretary, Official 2, X-Ray Official, Official 1, Official 2’s Secretary, Official 3, Official 4 and one person who only spoke English (name unknown ). This person may have been Official 5, because Non Staff member 1 stated that this person was not a Kosovar, but an International and furthermore, at a certain point w hen this person was not present, all the others congratulated Non Staff member 1 for his new job. The Investigators believe that the above-mentioned Airport staff were attempting to de monstrate to Non Staff member 1 that they were in contact with the competent person who could authorize his employment. Case-B 12. Non Staff member 1 stated that he/she was aware of another case of kickbacks for Pristina Airport employment, which occurred circa 6 Septembe r 2004. Non Staff member 1, in his role as the owner of a hamburger/sandwich stand/res taurant - well-frequented by airport employees – said he/she was contacted by KPS office r 2 who requested information in relation to what business connections Non Staff mem ber 4 had within Pristina Airport. 3 13. Non Staff member 1 stated that Non Staff member 5, the wife of KPS Officer 2 met Non Staff member 4 in the clothing boutique where he/sh e worked, while he/she was purchasing airport uniforms. At that time, he/she h ad asked him/her how to obtain a job at the airport. He/she allegedly replied he/she had no problems in getting him/her a job at Pristina Airport due to his/her important airport c ontacts, but it would cost him/her € 3.000,00. V – Conclusion 14. As ITF referred this case to the Department of Justice on 24 September 2004, no further action was taken by ITF. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn at this stage on the basis of ITF Investigations. V - Recommendations 15. The ITF offers the following recommendations: Recommendation No. 1 : Due to the fact that this case has already been r eferred to the International Prosecutor and is currently being inv estigated by the Financial Investigation Unit, the ITF recommends th at UNMIK Pillar IV take no administrative action against Air port staff until the/ judicial process is finalized (IV04/377/01); Recommendation No. 2 : Should the Airport staff not be criminally charge d by the Department of Justice, ITF recommends that UNMIK Pil lar IV should consider appropriate administrative action a gainst implicated Pristina Airport staff in the light of t he Department of Justice’s findings (IV04/377/02).",Hajvali; Pristi na Airport; Pristina Airport; Restaurant 1; Restaurant 2; UNMIK Pillar IV; the Pristina Airport Border Police,Pristina Airp ort; Septembe; whe n,Air; Airport; Department of Justice’s; III - Investigative; ITF; KPS; Kosovo Police Service; Non Staff; UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission; UNMIK Pil lar IV; cas h amounts; the Department of Just ice; the Department of Justice; the Financial Investigation Unit; the International Prosecutor; the Investigation Task Force,"1; 10; 10.000,00; 11; 14; 15; 190; 2; 2004; 215; 225; 24 September 2004; 25-26 July 2004; 2l5/04; 3; 3 13; 3.000,00; 30; 31 July 2004; 377/04; 4; 5; 5.000,00; 6; 7; 7,000.00; 8; 9; Airport St aff; English; Kosovar; an additional € 1.000,00; approximately € 180; night; one; three; two; two days later",DECEPTIVE PRACTICE,1,"{'doc_id': '13.pdf', 'timestamp': '2025-01-31T23:34:59.309127', 'length': 6610, 'dates': ['24 September 2004', '1', '25-26 July 2004', '31 July 2004', 'two days later', '2004', '24 September 2004']}"
14.pdf,"UNITED NATIONS   United Nations Interim  Administration Mission   in Kosovo    UNMIK NATIONS UNIES  Mission d’Administration  Intérimaire des Nations Unies  au Kosovo     INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE    Investigation into Allegations of Bribery and Favou ritism in Procurement of Uniforms  by Pristina Airport  (ITF Case No. 0462/04)    I. Background and Allegations    1. A Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) Internal Audit Unit (IAU) Internal Memorandum dated 4  October 2004, which described the audit of the proc urement of staff uniforms by Pristina  Airport, raised concerns as to the reasoning for th e cancellation of a competitive tender  for summer and winter uniforms (Pristina Airport Re ference No. PEAP/CG/UAS/19/05/04)  and the subsequent issue of a single source contrac t for summer uniforms for new staff  (Pristina Airport Reference No. SHKTA/CG/16-04).    2. In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter o f complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor  1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single  source contract to supply summer uniforms. The auth or of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager,  alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in t he matter of the bribery of  Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Fi nance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of  Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender proces s, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s  letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for  allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by:  re placing a member of the Bid Evaluation  Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a mem ber of the Finance Department, the  Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favou ring Vendor 2 in the tender process.    3. During the course of the investigation, Procurem ent Officer 1 told the ITF that, following  the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to  him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat.    4. The ITF commenced an inquiry into the allegation s regarding the procurement process  and now provides a summary of the case and its find ings and recommendations.      II. Applicable Law     5. The law applicable to each of the allegations is  detailed below.    Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor  2    Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 343 “ Accepting Bribes”; Article 344 “Giving  Bribes”    Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.3.2 –“Avoidance of  Conflicts of Interest and Corruption”    Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee    Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair  Competition”; Section 23.9 “Examination and Evaluat ion of Tenders”    Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid  Evaluation Committee     2Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair  Competition”; Section 23.9 “Examination and Evaluat ion of Tenders”    Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process    Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair  Competition”    Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1    Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 161 “ Threat”      III. Investigation Details     6. Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive te nder for the supply of uniforms. In  addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitt ed bids following which Procurement  Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Commit tee on 10-06-04. Present, in  addition to the committee that comprised members of  the various airport work groups,  were representatives of the three bidding companies  including Vendor 1 Manager.    7. Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the  offerings of the competitors, which comprised a ran ge of uniforms and accessories for the  various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-0 4, the committee, though not satisfied  with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in  favour of that company, the median  bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that  Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasi bility of no-cost design changes to  one of the uniforms for women employees. The commit tee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the  request of Pristina Airport Official. During the me eting, Pristina Airport Official announced  the cancellation of the tender. Pristina Airport Of ficial later awarded a single-source  procurement contract for summer uniforms for newly hired staff, in the amount of  €106,059, to Vendor 1, which had supplied uniforms to the airport under two previous  contracts.    Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor  2    8. When asked by the ITF to substantiate his/her al legation that Procurement Officer 1 and  the Finance Officer had accepted bribes from Vendor  2, Vendor 1 Manager said that  he/she had heard the rumours in Pristina coffee bar s but that he/she could not remember  from whom he/she had heard these rumours. He/she sa id that the witnesses to whom  he/she had referred in his letter of complaint were  actually the same persons from whom  he/she heard the rumours. Vendor 1 Manager was unab le to suggest which  representative of Vendor 2 had paid the bribes.    9. Vendor 2 Employee who attended the meeting of th e Bid Opening Committee; Vendor 2  Manager; and Vendor 2 Director all told ITF that th ey had not paid bribes to Procurement  Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer.    10. Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer b oth denied accepting bribes or any other  consideration from any person in this matter.    Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee    11. Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that  the original nominee to the committee,  Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day  that the committee first convened  and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee memb er 2, who then attended the  second session for continuity purposes. Committee m ember 1 and Committee member 2  confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for t he replacement.     3Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid  Evaluation Committee    12. The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that  the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluat ion Committee. However, Procurement  Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said t hat the other had nominated the Finance  Officer to the committee. KTA legal staff advised t he ITF that the wisdom of allowing a  representative of the Finance Department to partici pate in bid evaluations is questionable  because, generally, officers whose function involve s payment should not evaluate  contractors to whom payment will become due. Accord ing to KTA legal staff, however,  such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance  Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 D ecember 1999) – Public Procurement  Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes on ly an “approving officer” from the  Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contrac t from serving as a tender evaluator.  The Finance Officer was not an “approving officer” in this procurement process and,  therefore, was not prevented from serving as an eva luator.    Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process    13. In addition to Procurement Officer 1 and the Fi nance Officer, Bid Evaluation Committee  members Committee member 3, Committee member 4, Com mittee member 5,  Committee member 6, Committee member 2, and Committ ee member 7 told the ITF that  the conduct of the committee was completely fair an d proper. (Committee member 4 told  the ITF that he/she attended the first session of t he Bid Evaluation Committee but that  he/she missed the second session because of the ill ness of his son.) The general  consensus of the committee was that Vendor 2’s samp les were better overall in terms of  quality and design but the committee was not comple tely satisfied with Vendor 2’s goods.  However, Pristina Airport Official told the ITF tha t the committee was divided during the  second session, with one group preferring Vendor 2’ s goods and the other preferring  those of Vendor 1. Pristina Airport Official said t hat Procurement Officer 1 (who, as  committee chair, did not have the right to vote) an d the Finance Officer argued in favour  of Vendor 2. None of the committee members supporte d Pristina Airport Official’s  assertions in this regard.    14. The ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to re view a copy of the Bid Evaluation Committee  report prepared by Procurement Officer 1, the last page of which listed the attendees at  the session of the Bid Opening Committee (Procureme nt Officer 1 and the Finance  Officer were the only members of the Bid Opening Co mmittee who also served on the Bid  Evaluation Committee). Upon looking at the attendee  list of the Bid Opening Committee,  Pristina Airport Official named the committee membe rs who, he/she said, had Vendor 1’s  and Vendor 2’s samples respectively. He/she correct ly identified Procurement Officer 1  and the Finance Officer but the other four persons whom he/she named were members of  the Bid Opening Committee, not the Bid Evaluation C ommittee. Pristina Airport Official’s  mistaken identification of these persons as Bid Eva luation Committee members indicates  that his memory of the events of the second committ ee meeting might be unclear.    15. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she believed that had he/she not cancelled the  competitive tender, the Bid Evaluation Committee wo uld have awarded the contract to  Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/sh e believed that Procurement Officer 1  had been “primed” to award the contract to Vendor 2  because Procurement Officer 1 had  expressed a preference for and argued in support of  Vendor 2’s” inferior product and  because a source (whose identity Pristina Airport O fficial was unable to recall) had told  him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by  a person in either the Ministry of Finance or the M inistry of Transportation who was  associated with Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official  said that he/she cancelled the  competitive tender for these reasons. He/she said t hat he/she did not voice his suspicions  during the committee meeting, adding that he/she di d not subsequently report his  suspicions because “priming” is common and if he/sh e reported every instance he/she  would not have time to do his job. He/she said that  proving that Procurement Officer 1  had “pushed” one competitor would have been difficu lt.    16. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that a forme r Kosovo Minister is his godfather. He/she  said that he/she has never received a ride to the a irport from the Former Kosovo Minister   4or in his car. He/she said that he/she has no idea whether the Former Kosovo Minister is  in any way associated with Vendor 2. He/she said th at neither the Former Kosovo  Minister nor any other person pressured him/her to show favouritism to Vendor 2.    17. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she had not seen Vendor 1 Manager’s letter of  complaint and had never heard of Vendor 1 Manager’s  allegation regarding the bribery of  Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer. Howe ver, Pristina Airport Official’s  administrative assistant said that he/she had been present when Vendor 1 Manager  voiced his suspicion to Pristina Airport Official t hat an individual from the airport had  accepted bribes. Pristina Airport Official’ adminis trative assistant said that he/she could  not recall to whom Vendor 1 Manager referred. In ad dition, he/she told the ITF that  Vendor 1 Manager had given him/her his letter of co mplaint. Pristina Airport Official’s  administrative assistant said that he/she does not recall whether he/she handed the letter  to Pristina Airport Official or left it for his att ention and he/she does not recall Pristina  Airport Official mentioning the letter.    18. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that, fo llowing the cancellation of the competitive  tender, his only alternative to obtain uniforms for  newly hired staff was to award a contract  to Vendor 1, who had supplied the airport for the p ast two years. He/she said that had  he/she let a new tender for summer uniforms, the un iforms would not have been ready  until the end of August (2004).    19. ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to read a  copy of a memo dated 30-06-04 to him/her  from Procurement Officer 1 that described the event s of the tender process and  summarized the reasons for its cancellation. Pristi na Airport Official told the ITF that,  although he/she had signed the memo, he/she had not  “really read” it previously. The  articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed  below. Pristina Airport Official and  Procurement Officer 1 said that they had contribute d to the list of reasons but disagreed  over which of the reasons had been provided by whom , however, they both said that  Pristina Airport Official had provided the term “un satisfactory quality”.    i) unsatisfactory quality  ii) unsatisfactory design  iii) evaluation committee not satisfied with the un iforms  iv) no manufacturing details were given  v) documents not completed    20. Procurement Officer 2 told the ITF that he/she transmitted several documents regarding  the single-source procurement of summer uniforms to  KTA. Included in the document  package was a Procurement Memo dated 07-07-04 signe d by Pristina Airport Official and,  according to Procurement Officer 2, prepared by Pri stina Airport Official. (Pristina Airport  Official told the ITF that he/she believes that he/ she wrote the justification.) The  justification segment of the memo stated that unifo rms would be obtained by single- source procurement from the current supplier (Vendo r 1) for reasons of good quality and  durability.    21. The ITF pointed out to Pristina Airport Officia l that he/she had referred to the same  uniforms as being of “unsatisfactory quality” and “ good quality” in the respective  documents. He/she then admitted “flowering up” his memo and providing embellishment  to ensure that KTA would approve the procurement. H e/she said that the term  “unsatisfactory quality” in the memo dated 30-06-04  was poorly chosen and that the  quality of Vendor 1’s uniforms actually met the air port’s requirements. However, he/she  said that the design of the uniforms design was “ba sic and poor.”    Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1    22. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, on a d ay (he/she could not specify the date)  following the second meeting of the Bid Evaluation Committee at which the decision was  taken to cancel the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Ma nager entered Procurement Officer  1’s office and, in the presence of Procurement Offi cer 2 and a Pristina Airport Civil  Engineer made utterances that Procurement Officer 1  interpreted as a threat. According  to Procurement Officer 1, Vendor 1 Manager said tha t he/she would meet Procurement  Officer 1 outside; that, because he/she had cancell ed the tender, Procurement Officer 1   5would find out who Vendor 1 Manager was; and that P rocurement Officer 1 would see  what he/she had done by canceling the tender.    23. Procurement Officer 2 assistant confirmed that he/she had been present during the  incident but he/she had paid only partial attention  to what transpired. He/She said that  Vendor 1 Manager might have mentioned that Procurem ent Officer 1 would have to deal  with KTA Internal Audit and the Investigation Task Force. The Civil Engineer also  confirmed his presence and said that he/she could r ecall Vendor 1 Manager saying  something to the effect of “You have to see who I a m.” The Civil Engineer said that  he/she interpreted the words to mean that Procureme nt Officer 1 should be afraid of  Vendor 1 Manager.    24. Vendor 1 Manager confirmed that an incident had  occurred between him/her and  Procurement Officer 1. Vendor 1 Manager said that h e/she told Procurement Officer 1  that he/she was the main reason for the cancellatio n of the tender and that he/she told  Procurement Officer 1 “You’ll see what you have don e. You’ll see that I’ll go to the highest  levels and if necessary, I’ll see you in court.” Ve ndor 1 Manager said that he/she did not  ask Procurement Officer 1 to go outside with him/he r, that he/she did not threaten  Procurement Officer 1 and did not imply that he/she  would commit physical aggression.      IV. Findings of Fact    Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor  2    25. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1  and/or the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Ven dor 2 in this matter. Moreover, the  ITF did not find evidence that any person received a bribe or other compensation or a  promise of a bribe or other compensation in relatio n to either the competitive tender or the  single-source procurement. Therefore, the allegatio n of bribery is considered to be  unsubstantiated.    Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee    26. The rationale for replacing the member of the B id Evaluation Committee is reasonable.  Furthermore, Vendor 1 Manager did not intimate that  the replacement was made for any  questionable purpose. Therefore, the allegation is considered to be correct but the  substantive act is not considered to have been base d on ulterior motives.    Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately placed  the Finance Officer on the Bid  Evaluation Committee    27. The ITF established that the Finance Officer pa rticipated on the committee but did not  determine whether he/she was nominated by Procureme nt Officer 1 or Pristina Airport  Official. Regardless, the ITF did not identify any indication that The Finance Officer’s  behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofess ional or improper. In the absence  of specific regulations precluding the participatio n of finance personnel in such processes,  this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated .    Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process    28. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1 had  favoured Vendor 2 during the tender process. Simila rly, Pristina Airport Official’s opinion  that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to sel ect Vendor 2 is unsubstantiated. The  credibility of Pristina Airport Official’s portraya l of Procurement Officer 1 as a strong  proponent of Vendor 2 in a divided committee was co ntradicted by the committee  members themselves and undermined by Pristina Airpo rt Official’s misidentification of  most of the members. Procurement Officer 1’s manage ment of the proceedings appears  to have been fair and objective based on the assert ions of the members of the Bid  Evaluation Committee. Therefore, this allegation is  considered to be unsubstantiated.    Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1   6  29. The ITF was unable to substantiate that Vendor 1 Manager’s utterances constituted a  threat against Procurement Officer 1.      V. Recommendations    30.  The ITF offers the following recommendations:    Recommendation No. 1 : It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV inform Pro curement Officer 1  and the Finance Officer, as well as the KTA Interna l Audit Unit, that the ITF did not find any  wrongdoing on the part of Procurement Officer 1 or the Finance Officer. (IV04/462/01)    Recommendation No. 2 : It is recommended that UNMIK provide this report to both the  Department of Justice and the Financial Investigati on Unit for information purposes, so as to  assist current investigations related to the allege d payment of “kickbacks” in exchange for  employment at Pristina Airport. (IV04/462/02)","UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE Investigation into Allegations of Bribery and Favou ritism in Procurement of Uniforms by Pristina Airport (ITF Case No. 0462/04) I. Background and Allegations 1. A Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) Internal Audit Unit (IAU) Internal Memorandum dated 4 October 2004, which described the audit of the proc urement of staff uniforms by Pristina Airport, raised concerns as to the reasoning for th e cancellation of a competitive tender for summer and winter uniforms (Pristina Airport Re ference No. PEAP/CG/UAS/19/05/04) and the subsequent issue of a single source contrac t for summer uniforms for new staff (Pristina Airport Reference No. SHKTA/CG/16-04). 2. In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter o f complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor 1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single source contract to supply summer uniforms. The auth or of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager, alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in t he matter of the bribery of Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Fi nance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender proces s, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: re placing a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a mem ber of the Finance Department, the Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favou ring Vendor 2 in the tender process. 3. During the course of the investigation, Procurem ent Officer 1 told the ITF that, following the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat. 4. The ITF commenced an inquiry into the allegation s regarding the procurement process and now provides a summary of the case and its find ings and recommendations. II. Applicable Law 5. The law applicable to each of the allegations is detailed below.

Investigation Details 6. Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive te nder for the supply of uniforms. In addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitt ed bids following which Procurement Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Commit tee on 10-06-04. Present, in addition to the committee that comprised members of the various airport work groups, were representatives of the three bidding companies including Vendor 1 Manager. 7. Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the offerings of the competitors, which comprised a ran ge of uniforms and accessories for the various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-0 4, the committee, though not satisfied with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in favour of that company, the median bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasi bility of no-cost design changes to one of the uniforms for women employees. The commit tee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the request of Pristina Airport Official. During the me eting, Pristina Airport Official announced the cancellation of the tender. Pristina Airport Of ficial later awarded a single-source procurement contract for summer uniforms for newly hired staff, in the amount of €106,059, to Vendor 1, which had supplied uniforms to the airport under two previous contracts. Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor 2 8. When asked by the ITF to substantiate his/her al legation that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer had accepted bribes from Vendor 2, Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she had heard the rumours in Pristina coffee bar s but that he/she could not remember from whom he/she had heard these rumours. He/she sa id that the witnesses to whom he/she had referred in his letter of complaint were actually the same persons from whom he/she heard the rumours. Vendor 1 Manager was unab le to suggest which representative of Vendor 2 had paid the bribes. 9. Vendor 2 Employee who attended the meeting of th e Bid Opening Committee; Vendor 2 Manager; and Vendor 2 Director all told ITF that th ey had not paid bribes to Procurement Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer. 10. Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer b oth denied accepting bribes or any other consideration from any person in this matter. Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee 11. Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee, Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee memb er 2, who then attended the second session for continuity purposes. Committee m ember 1 and Committee member 2 confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for t he replacement. 3Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid Evaluation Committee 12. The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluat ion Committee. However, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said t hat the other had nominated the Finance Officer to the committee. KTA legal staff advised t he ITF that the wisdom of allowing a representative of the Finance Department to partici pate in bid evaluations is questionable because, generally, officers whose function involve s payment should not evaluate contractors to whom payment will become due. Accord ing to KTA legal staff, however, such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 D ecember 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes on ly an “approving officer” from the Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contrac t from serving as a tender evaluator. The Finance Officer was not an “approving officer” in this procurement process and, therefore, was not prevented from serving as an eva luator. Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process 13. In addition to Procurement Officer 1 and the Fi nance Officer, Bid Evaluation Committee members Committee member 3, Committee member 4, Com mittee member 5, Committee member 6, Committee member 2, and Committ ee member 7 told the ITF that the conduct of the committee was completely fair an d proper. (Committee member 4 told the ITF that he/she attended the first session of t he Bid Evaluation Committee but that he/she missed the second session because of the ill ness of his son.) The general consensus of the committee was that Vendor 2’s samp les were better overall in terms of quality and design but the committee was not comple tely satisfied with Vendor 2’s goods. However, Pristina Airport Official told the ITF tha t the committee was divided during the second session, with one group preferring Vendor 2’ s goods and the other preferring those of Vendor 1. Pristina Airport Official said t hat Procurement Officer 1 (who, as committee chair, did not have the right to vote) an d the Finance Officer argued in favour of Vendor 2. None of the committee members supporte d Pristina Airport Official’s assertions in this regard. 14. The ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to re view a copy of the Bid Evaluation Committee report prepared by Procurement Officer 1, the last page of which listed the attendees at the session of the Bid Opening Committee (Procureme nt Officer 1 and the Finance Officer were the only members of the Bid Opening Co mmittee who also served on the Bid Evaluation Committee). Upon looking at the attendee list of the Bid Opening Committee, Pristina Airport Official named the committee membe rs who, he/she said, had Vendor 1’s and Vendor 2’s samples respectively. He/she correct ly identified Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer but the other four persons whom he/she named were members of the Bid Opening Committee, not the Bid Evaluation C ommittee. Pristina Airport Official’s mistaken identification of these persons as Bid Eva luation Committee members indicates that his memory of the events of the second committ ee meeting might be unclear. 15. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she believed that had he/she not cancelled the competitive tender, the Bid Evaluation Committee wo uld have awarded the contract to Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/sh e believed that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to award the contract to Vendor 2 because Procurement Officer 1 had expressed a preference for and argued in support of Vendor 2’s” inferior product and because a source (whose identity Pristina Airport O fficial was unable to recall) had told him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by a person in either the Ministry of Finance or the M inistry of Transportation who was associated with Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/she cancelled the competitive tender for these reasons. He/she said t hat he/she did not voice his suspicions during the committee meeting, adding that he/she di d not subsequently report his suspicions because “priming” is common and if he/sh e reported every instance he/she would not have time to do his job. He/she said that proving that Procurement Officer 1 had “pushed” one competitor would have been difficu lt. 16. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that a forme r Kosovo Minister is his godfather. He/she said that he/she has never received a ride to the a irport from the Former Kosovo Minister 4or in his car. He/she said that he/she has no idea whether the Former Kosovo Minister is in any way associated with Vendor 2. He/she said th at neither the Former Kosovo Minister nor any other person pressured him/her to show favouritism to Vendor 2. 17. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she had not seen Vendor 1 Manager’s letter of complaint and had never heard of Vendor 1 Manager’s allegation regarding the bribery of Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer. Howe ver, Pristina Airport Official’s administrative assistant said that he/she had been present when Vendor 1 Manager voiced his suspicion to Pristina Airport Official t hat an individual from the airport had accepted bribes. Pristina Airport Official’ adminis trative assistant said that he/she could not recall to whom Vendor 1 Manager referred. In ad dition, he/she told the ITF that Vendor 1 Manager had given him/her his letter of co mplaint. Pristina Airport Official’s administrative assistant said that he/she does not recall whether he/she handed the letter to Pristina Airport Official or left it for his att ention and he/she does not recall Pristina Airport Official mentioning the letter. 18. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that, fo llowing the cancellation of the competitive tender, his only alternative to obtain uniforms for newly hired staff was to award a contract to Vendor 1, who had supplied the airport for the p ast two years. He/she said that had he/she let a new tender for summer uniforms, the un iforms would not have been ready until the end of August (2004). 19. ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to read a copy of a memo dated 30-06-04 to him/her from Procurement Officer 1 that described the event s of the tender process and summarized the reasons for its cancellation. Pristi na Airport Official told the ITF that, although he/she had signed the memo, he/she had not “really read” it previously. The articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed below. Pristina Airport Official and Procurement Officer 1 said that they had contribute d to the list of reasons but disagreed over which of the reasons had been provided by whom , however, they both said that Pristina Airport Official had provided the term “un satisfactory quality”. i) unsatisfactory quality ii) unsatisfactory design iii) evaluation committee not satisfied with the un iforms iv) no manufacturing details were given v) documents not completed 20. Procurement Officer 2 told the ITF that he/she transmitted several documents regarding the single-source procurement of summer uniforms to KTA. Included in the document package was a Procurement Memo dated 07-07-04 signe d by Pristina Airport Official and, according to Procurement Officer 2, prepared by Pri stina Airport Official. (Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/she believes that he/ she wrote the justification.) The justification segment of the memo stated that unifo rms would be obtained by single- source procurement from the current supplier (Vendo r 1) for reasons of good quality and durability. 21. The ITF pointed out to Pristina Airport Officia l that he/she had referred to the same uniforms as being of “unsatisfactory quality” and “ good quality” in the respective documents. He/she then admitted “flowering up” his memo and providing embellishment to ensure that KTA would approve the procurement. H e/she said that the term “unsatisfactory quality” in the memo dated 30-06-04 was poorly chosen and that the quality of Vendor 1’s uniforms actually met the air port’s requirements. However, he/she said that the design of the uniforms design was “ba sic and poor.” Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1 22. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, on a d ay (he/she could not specify the date) following the second meeting of the Bid Evaluation Committee at which the decision was taken to cancel the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Ma nager entered Procurement Officer 1’s office and, in the presence of Procurement Offi cer 2 and a Pristina Airport Civil Engineer made utterances that Procurement Officer 1 interpreted as a threat. According to Procurement Officer 1, Vendor 1 Manager said tha t he/she would meet Procurement Officer 1 outside; that, because he/she had cancell ed the tender, Procurement Officer 1 5would find out who Vendor 1 Manager was; and that P rocurement Officer 1 would see what he/she had done by canceling the tender. 23. Procurement Officer 2 assistant confirmed that he/she had been present during the incident but he/she had paid only partial attention to what transpired. He/She said that Vendor 1 Manager might have mentioned that Procurem ent Officer 1 would have to deal with KTA Internal Audit and the Investigation Task Force. The Civil Engineer also confirmed his presence and said that he/she could r ecall Vendor 1 Manager saying something to the effect of “You have to see who I a m.” The Civil Engineer said that he/she interpreted the words to mean that Procureme nt Officer 1 should be afraid of Vendor 1 Manager. 24. Vendor 1 Manager confirmed that an incident had occurred between him/her and Procurement Officer 1. Vendor 1 Manager said that h e/she told Procurement Officer 1 that he/she was the main reason for the cancellatio n of the tender and that he/she told Procurement Officer 1 “You’ll see what you have don e. You’ll see that I’ll go to the highest levels and if necessary, I’ll see you in court.” Ve ndor 1 Manager said that he/she did not ask Procurement Officer 1 to go outside with him/he r, that he/she did not threaten Procurement Officer 1 and did not imply that he/she would commit physical aggression. IV. Findings of Fact Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor 2 25. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Ven dor 2 in this matter. Moreover, the ITF did not find evidence that any person received a bribe or other compensation or a promise of a bribe or other compensation in relatio n to either the competitive tender or the single-source procurement. Therefore, the allegatio n of bribery is considered to be unsubstantiated. Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee 26. The rationale for replacing the member of the B id Evaluation Committee is reasonable. Furthermore, Vendor 1 Manager did not intimate that the replacement was made for any questionable purpose. Therefore, the allegation is considered to be correct but the substantive act is not considered to have been base d on ulterior motives. Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately placed the Finance Officer on the Bid Evaluation Committee 27. The ITF established that the Finance Officer pa rticipated on the committee but did not determine whether he/she was nominated by Procureme nt Officer 1 or Pristina Airport Official. Regardless, the ITF did not identify any indication that The Finance Officer’s behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofess ional or improper. In the absence of specific regulations precluding the participatio n of finance personnel in such processes, this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated . Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process 28. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1 had favoured Vendor 2 during the tender process. Simila rly, Pristina Airport Official’s opinion that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to sel ect Vendor 2 is unsubstantiated. The credibility of Pristina Airport Official’s portraya l of Procurement Officer 1 as a strong proponent of Vendor 2 in a divided committee was co ntradicted by the committee members themselves and undermined by Pristina Airpo rt Official’s misidentification of most of the members. Procurement Officer 1’s manage ment of the proceedings appears to have been fair and objective based on the assert ions of the members of the Bid Evaluation Committee. Therefore, this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated. Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1 6 29. The ITF was unable to substantiate that Vendor 1 Manager’s utterances constituted a threat against Procurement Officer 1. V. Recommendations 30. The ITF offers the following recommendations: Recommendation No. 1 : It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV inform Pro curement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer, as well as the KTA Interna l Audit Unit, that the ITF did not find any wrongdoing on the part of Procurement Officer 1 or the Finance Officer. (IV04/462/01) Recommendation No. 2 : It is recommended that UNMIK provide this report to both the Department of Justice and the Financial Investigati on Unit for information purposes, so as to assist current investigations related to the allege d payment of “kickbacks” in exchange for employment at Pristina Airport.

OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES  INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION          REDACTED  REPORT OF INVESTIGATION      ID CASE NO. 0374/04                  28 February 2005         STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   `   1 INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES IN THE PR OCUREMENT OF  PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS  (Case 0374/04)       I.     BACKGROUND    1. The Investigations Division of the Office of Int ernal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS)  received information relating to problems in a proc urement exercise for the purchase of Personal  Digital Assistants (PDA) undertaken in April 2004 b y UNMIK’s Directorate of Rural Affairs  (DRA), Kosovo.  A letter of complaint from one of t he bidders alleged possible irregularities in  the bid evaluation and selection process.     2. An internal Pillar II review by the Policy Revie w and Internal Oversight Unit (PRIO)  highlighted possible irregularities in its prelimin ary report on the procurement exercise with a  recommendation for further investigation. This repo rt was provided to ID/OIOS with a request  for further investigation. Based on the issues rais ed in the complaint and subsequently in the  PRIO Unit’s preliminary report, ID/OIOS investigate d the entire tender process to determine  whether any violations of UN rules had occurred.    3. The Directorate of Rural Affairs (DRA) is locate d within UNMIK Civil Administration  (Pillar II); it was formed in October 2001 out of t he former Department of Agriculture in the  Joint Administrative Interim Structure. The DRA com prises Veterinary Services & Veterinary  Border Control, Phytosanitary Border Control and Pu blic Forests.  The DRA remains a reserved  area under Security Council Resolution 1244 and the  staff are United Nations staff members  subject to the UN Rules and Regulations. Also, the DRA undertakes its own procurement for all  of the divisions within the DRA.      II.     INVESTIGATION DETAILS    4. ID/OIOS Investigators conducted interviews of al l witnesses relevant to this matter,  including detailed interviews of the alleged subjec ts; collected documents and records  concerning the procurement, including all the bids submitted and the bid evaluation documents:  and analyzed the evidence.       5. The ID/OIOS investigation also reviewed the proj ect funded by the European Agency for  Reconstruction (EAR) called “Strengthening of Publi c Veterinary Services in Kosovo”  (SPUVESEK), which identified the need for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to undertake the  task of Identification & Registration (I & R) of an imals in Kosovo. The intent was to provide  veterinarians in the field with electronic devices to record all movements of animals in Kosovo.    6. In late 2002, the EAR consultant prepared the te chnical specifications for the PDAs based  on the proposal in SPUVESEK’s inception report of A ugust 2002. Based on these specifications,  the DRA launched an initial tender in November 2003  for the PDAs, inclusive of both hardware  and software.  All bids submitted exceeded the amou nt set aside for the purchase of the PDAs  (€170,000), therefore that tender was cancelled in February 2004 based on advice from the  Central Procurement Entity (CPE).     `   2 7. A second tender for the purchase of the required  PDAs was then launched in April 2004,  using the same technical specifications. For the se cond tender, the DRA provided the bidders  with a price ceiling of €135,000 and requested that  they state the number of devices in total that  the company could offer within the price ceiling. O n 19 May 2004, the deadline for the  submission of bids, the DRA had received eight bids . As required, the bids were opened and  certified by members of a bid-opening panel consist ing of DRA logistics officer 1, a DRA  procurement officer, DRA employee 1 and a DRA finan ce officer.  The complainant told  ID/OIOS that the bid opening process occurred witho ut incident and in accordance with correct  procedural requirements.    8. In the preliminary PRIO report, the price estima tes as stated in the EAR consultant’s  inception report showed five different PDA models w ith integrated scanner capabilities. The  prices of the PDA models shown ranged from USD $323 .38 to USD $818.30. ID/OIOS  adduced that the initial estimates were of regular PDAs, not the more rugged PDAs specified  in the technical specifications and required for us e by veterinarians working in inclement  weather conditions.  ID/OIOS also found that the es timates were obtained from the Internet for  the inception report and did not include the featur es that would make it technically appropriate  for the veterinarians in the field. The actual tech nical specifications prepared by the EAR  consultant later envisaged a more rugged, durable p roduct that would be water, dust and drop  resistant. The price per unit of “rugged” PDAs, as required by the technical specifications, is  higher than the initial estimate made in the incept ion report. ID/OIOS verified this through  Internet research.     9.  The complainant raised two main issues: firstly , that the bid submitted by Vendor 1, was  the lowest bid because it offered the most number o f devices within the ceiling price. Secondly,  although two other bidders offered the same product  as the winning bidder, but at a lower price,  they had not been selected. The PRIO preliminary re port also identified these issues. ID/OIOS  Investigators reviewed all eight bids submitted and  noted that DRA logistics officer 1 had  disqualified two, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3, because ne ither the Vendor 2 nor the Vendor 3 bid was  substantially responsive in that the total price of  the product offered exceeded the price ceiling of  €135,000. During his/her pre-qualification of bids,  DRA logistics officer 1 noted that Vendor 2  did not include taxes “CIP” Pristina Kosovo as requ ired in the bid document, meaning the total  price would exceed the ceiling of €135,000 by more than €17,000; and Vendor 3’s total offer did  not include its  yearly €16,500 maintenance surcharge fee, causing its bid t o exceed the stated  price ceiling by more than €15,000.       10. In order to find out why the lowest bidder, Ven dor 1, was still not selected, ID/OIOS  spoke separately with two members of the bid evalua tion panel who explained the evaluation  process and why the panel recommended the selected bidder, Vendor 4. ID/OIOS was told that  the  evaluation panel examined the bid documents submit ted by the six pre-qualified bidders and  made comments and annotations on the table provided  to them by the DRA logistics officer. The  evaluation panel relied heavily on the technical ex pertise of one panel member, DRA logistics  officer 2, who was responsible for the evaluation o f the technical features of the PDAs offered.  DRA logistics officer 2 told ID/OIOS that his/her handwritten entries on th e table were based  on the discussions of the entire evaluation panel, but that he/she independently verified that the  product offered by each bidder did possess the decl ared features and that he/she checked the  `   3 technical data submitted by the individual bidders with the product datasheet and brochures  included in the bidding documents.      11. In terms of the priority selection criteria of the evaluation panel, DRA logistics officer 2  stated that the DRA had advised them to monitor not  only the technical specifications but to  focus particularly on Section VII of the Bidding Do cuments “Obligatory Requirements to be  fulfilled by the bidders.” DRA logistics officer 2  highlighted the criteria of after-warranty  repair service located within Kosovo and repair or replacement within five working days  (based on the existing regulations in Kosovo as to notification, registration and recording of  information concerning movement of animals within f ive days of the movement).  Therefore, if  a PDA device used for the communication of such dat a broke down and was not replaced  within a week, farmers and veterinarians would run the risk of not complying with the law.    12.  ID/OIOS requested DRA logistics officer 2  to review each individual bid and to  explain his/her  13.   annotations.  DRA logistics officer 2  pointed out that Vendor 4, Vendor 5 and  Vendor 6 had offered virtually the same technical d evice. He/she found out that the  “Gotive H41 IB” model offered by Vendor 6 did not s ubstantially differ from the  “Gotive H41” model offered by Vendor 4 and Vendor 5 . DRA logistics officer 2   stated that the “Gotive H41” model complied with al l the requirements laid out in  the technical specifications and pointed out that t his device was very well protected  against environmental impact, notably in the field.          13. According to DRA logistics officer 2 , the PDA model offered by Vendor 1 was not a  rugged PDA; it did not comply with the IP54 protect ion standards essential for outdoor use.   At first glance, Vendor 1 appeared to be the lowest  bidder, because they offered the largest  number of PDAs for the stated price ceiling. Howeve r, the product did not comply with the  technical specifications and hence would be inappro priate for use by KVS veterinarians. As  such, the members of the evaluation panel did not s hort-list Vendor 1 for further examination.      14. However, the complainant contended that the PDA mod el offered by Vendor 1 did match  the technical specifications sought by the DRA and referred ID/OIOS to “Vendor 1’s”  handwritten responses to Section VI “Technical Spec ifications” of the Bidding documents. These  handwritten responses simply mark “Y” for yes and “ N” for No as to whether the product  conformed to the technical specifications. The hand written version shows a “Y” in the column  next to the technical requirement of environmental sealing.  Investigators noted that the annex  submitted by the complainant is different from the typed page of the Vendor 1 response to  Section VI found in all three sets of bid documents  submitted to the DRA at the bid opening.   The typed page clearly indicates that the product d oes not contain the required dust and weather  resistance feature required.     15. ID/OIOS learned that Vendor 1 did not retain a copy of the completed bid documents  submitted to the DRA as they had only prepared thre e sets, all of which were submitted to the  DRA on 19 May. The complainant seemed unaware of th e discrepancy between the two  versions. ID/OIOS verified that the PDA model offer ed by Vendor 1 (EIA PD264-XB) does not  `   4 contain the IP54 feature that would ensure environm ental sealing against dust and rain. It did  appear from the complainant’s statements to ID/OIOS  that Vendor 1 did not fully understand the  bidding document requirements and thus failed to of fer a technically compliant product that  would be appropriate for outdoor use by Kosovo vete rinarians.    16. ID/OIOS also addressed the issue of why Vendor 4 was selected even though two other  bidders offered the same model PDA at a lower price . Based on the technical specifications, the  evaluation panel narrowed the choices to three bidd ers whose product was technically compliant  with the specifications.  Two panel members told ID /OIOS that among the three short-listed  bidders, the Vendor 4  offer seemed to be slightly more expensive than th at of Vendor 5 and  Vendor 6.  A more thorough review indicated that bo th Vendor 5 and Vendor 6 did not include  VAT in their offers; therefore, the total bid by th ese two vendors did not offer the best value.  In addition, neither Vendor 5 nor Vendor 6  offered servicing and repair of the PDAs in Kosovo   and the required five days turnaround time to repla ce a faulty device.  Only the selected bidder,  Vendor 4, offered these two features along with a t raining component for the price submitted.   Given the fact that approximately 70 veterinarians were to be equipped with these PDAs, the  training component, although not included in the ob ligatory requirements, seemed to be a  valuable addition to the evaluation panel members.  In the end, the evaluation panel members  selected Vendor 4 over the two other short-listed b idders because that bid included training as  part of the total package thereby offering the best  value within the stated price ceiling for  DRA-KVS.            III.     FINDINGS    17.   ID/OIOS finds that the DRA finally procured P DAs from Vendor 4 based on the fact  that the product offered was in compliance with the  technical specifications and met the  requirements of the bid specifications.  The lower price estimates quoted in the inception report  related to standard office use PDAs as opposed to r ugged, environmentally sealed PDAs that  would be suitable for outdoor use.      18. ID/OIOS also finds that the evaluation panel se lected Vendor 4 because it was the only  bidder that complied with all technical specificati ons as well as the obligatory requirements in  Section VII of the bid documents such as the 12 mon ths warranty for servicing and repair in  Kosovo and the five days turnaround time. In additi on, it offered the best value by including a  training component in their offer.     19. The evidence adduced by the investigation furth er confirms that the PDAs offered by  Vendor 1 did not conform to the technical specifica tions of the ITB.  Although the complainant  offered the largest number of PDAs within the state d ceiling price, the PDAs offered were not  appropriate for the designated use as set forth in the bid documents.      20. ID/OIOS determined that the procurement exercis e was conducted in accordance with the  UN Financial Rules and Regulations governing procur ement and with UNMIK’s Finance  Administrative Instruction 2/1999 on public procure ments using KCB funds.      `   5 IV.     RECOMMENDATION    21. Based on the above, ID/OIOS makes the following  the recommendation:    Recommendation 1 : It is recommended that UNMIK take note of ID/OIOS ’ findings and  conclusions and advise DRA staff members, DRA emplo yee 2 and DRA logistics officer 1 of the  result of this investigation.

OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION REDACTED REPORT OF INVESTIGATION ID CASE NO. 0374/04 28 February 2005 STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ` 1 INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES IN THE PR OCUREMENT OF PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS (Case 0374/04) I. BACKGROUND 1. The Investigations Division of the Office of Int ernal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received information relating to problems in a proc urement exercise for the purchase of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) undertaken in April 2004 b y UNMIK’s Directorate of Rural Affairs (DRA), Kosovo. A letter of complaint from one of t he bidders alleged possible irregularities in the bid evaluation and selection process. 2. An internal Pillar II review by the Policy Revie w and Internal Oversight Unit (PRIO) highlighted possible irregularities in its prelimin ary report on the procurement exercise with a recommendation for further investigation. This repo rt was provided to ID/OIOS with a request for further investigation. Based on the issues rais ed in the complaint and subsequently in the PRIO Unit’s preliminary report, ID/OIOS investigate d the entire tender process to determine whether any violations of UN rules had occurred. 3. The Directorate of Rural Affairs (DRA) is locate d within UNMIK Civil Administration (Pillar II); it was formed in October 2001 out of t he former Department of Agriculture in the Joint Administrative Interim Structure. The DRA com prises Veterinary Services & Veterinary Border Control, Phytosanitary Border Control and Pu blic Forests. The DRA remains a reserved area under Security Council Resolution 1244 and the staff are United Nations staff members subject to the UN Rules and Regulations. Also, the DRA undertakes its own procurement for all of the divisions within the DRA. II. INVESTIGATION DETAILS 4. ID/OIOS Investigators conducted interviews of al l witnesses relevant to this matter, including detailed interviews of the alleged subjec ts; collected documents and records concerning the procurement, including all the bids submitted and the bid evaluation documents: and analyzed the evidence. 5.

INTRODUCTION     1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) Kosovo, condu cted an investigation into  the circumstances surrounding frequent cash withdra wals made from the bank  account of Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS), Pri shtina International Airport.  This  investigation was triggered by a forensic audit rep ort of Public Enterprise Airport  Prishtina (PEAP) and ATCS that was released in Febr uary 2003 by the Chartered  Accountants. The activities of the Prishtina Airpor t fall under the control of the  Kosovo Trust Agency and UNMIK Pillar IV, which is a dministered by the European  Union. Investigations into allegations of fraud and  corruption involving UNMIK, its  pillars and other organizational structures as well  as the Provisional Institutions of  Self-Government (PISG) and independent bodies and o ffices established pursuant to  the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-G overnment in Kosovo fall  within the purview of ITF as laid out by the Execut ive Decision on the Establishment  of the Investigation Task Force UNMIK/ED/2003/16, d ated 21 October 2003.      II. APPLICABLE LAWS     2. Pursuant to the authority given to The Special R epresentative of the  Secretary-General, under United Nations Security Co uncil resolution 1244 (1999)  of  10 June 1999, taking into account United Nations In terim Administration Mission in  Kosovo (UNMIK) Regulation No. 1999/ 1 of 25 July 1999 on the Authority of the  Interim Administration in Kosovo, for the purpose o f defining the law applicable in  Kosovo, the SRSG promulgated that the law applicabl e in Kosovo shall be:     a)  The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments issued  there under; and   2 of 12   b)  The law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.    3.  With regards to performance and conduct of the empl oyees of KTA, the  following UNMIK Regulation shall apply:     UNMIK Regulation No. 2001/27, Dated 8 October 2001-  On Essential Labour  Law In Kosovo - Section 11- Termination of a Labour  Contract, states the  following ( extract ):     11.3.  Serious misconduct shall include the followi ng:    (a) unjustified refusal to perform the obligations set out in the labour contract;  (b) theft, destruction, damage or unauthorized use of the employer’s assets;  (c) disclosure of business secrets;  (d) consumption of drugs or alcohol at work; and  (e) behavior of such a serious nature that it would  be unreasonable to expect        the employment relationship to continue.    11.4.  Unsatisfactory performance shall include the  following:    (a) unjustified absence from work; and  (b) repeated mistakes not sufficient in themselves to justify a dismissal, but  which given their frequency and seriousness disrupt  the normal course of the      employment relationship.      III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION     4. A review of the airport’s bank accounts and docu ments related to airport  operations, contracts, and financial matters reveal ed a number of cash withdrawals  from the ATCS bank account, many of them in €10.000  increments.  Between July  2002 and November 2003, an amount of €642.000 was w ithdrawn in cash.  The  majority of the withdrawals were identified as bein g for air travel and related  expenses for the then the ATCS Official; similarly for other ATCS employees; and  also for the so-called ‘petty cash’ purposes. The f orensic audit report of February  2003 highlighted that the ATCS Official travelled f requently and questioned whether  the trips were necessary, or were approved.    5. It was established that on 01 July 2002, the new  Division Manager, Airport  Sector UNMIK Pillar 4 was appointed with overall re sponsibility for Prishtina  Airport.  The ATCS Official was in charge of the De partment, which included day- to-day management of the ATCS Finance Office.  Fina nce Officer 1 and Finance  Officer 2 were employed as ATCS Finance Officers, b oth of them directly supervised  by the ATCS Official. It should be also mentioned t hat the ATCS Official, Finance  3 of 12   Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 were working at ATC S prior to the arrival of the  Division Manager.        IV. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS     6. The ITF investigation was focused on the examina tion of two main areas; a)  travel arrangements and cash expenses related to th e official travel of ATCS staff  and b) handling of the so-called ATCS petty cash. D uring this investigation the ITF  Investigators:    • Reviewed existing procedures related to the cash wi thdrawals in 2002 and  2003 in view of establishing whether those procedur es were properly  followed and enforced by the management of ATCS;    • Examined ATCS bank account and related records;    • Examined the cash withdrawal requests, supporting d ocumentation, and  receipts including airline tickets, hotel bills, an d other receipts;    • Reviewed the so-called petty cash files and related  documentation;    • Cross-checked the staff details on record and their  employment roles during  the time period in question, including their offici al right to authorize cash  withdrawals from ATCS bank account;     • Compared signatures found on the examined documents  against the  signatures on the staff files;    • Cross-checked specific sums against the airport “ex cel” cash spreadsheets  and the master bank account. (Note: the “excel” spr eadsheet system has been  in place since mid-2002 and is used to maintain a “ cashbook”);    • Interviewed ATCS staff, in particular the Division Manager; the ATCS  Officials; and Finance Officers 1 and 2. ITF Invest igators also interviewed  Official 1 at Prishtina Airport, and the Official 2  at Prishtina Airport.     7. During the review of available documentation, th e ITF investigators  identified a number of problems related to the exis ting procedures and practices at  ATCS Finance Office. Having finalized the document review they interviewed  available ATCS staff that was directly involved in approving the cash withdrawals  and subsequently ATCS staff that handled the cash a nd related documentation at  4 of 12   the ATCS Finance Office, or that travelled on train ing to Italy and the United  Kingdom.      8.  The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 1, working at ATCS Finance Office  during the period September 2000 to December 2003. Finance Officer 1 described the  procedures that were in place during 2002 and 2003 and identified Employee 1,  Employee 2 and the Division Manager as “A” class si gnatories and Employee 3,  Employee 4, Employee 5 and the ATCS Official as “B”  class signatories for the  UNMIK Aviation Transport and Airport Prishtina bank  accounts. Those listed “A”  class signatories were the only people authorized t o withdraw cash from the ATCS  bank accounts.     9. Finance Officer 1 also confirmed that the Divisi on Manager and the ATCS  Official supervised the work of the ATCS Finance Of fice. He/she further indicated  that whenever there was a requirement for a larger cash payment, (for example, an  official travel), Finance Officer 1 or Finance Offi cer 2 would prepare a “request for  cash withdrawal” that would be signed by the ATCS O fficial and subsequently  assessed and approved by the Division Manager.    10. Finance Officer 1 was given the opportunity to review documentation related  to the travel of ATCS staff in 2002 prior to the ta keover of the ATCS by UNMIK  Pillar 4 – KTA on 1 July 2002. During this exercise , Finance Officer 1 established that   “requests for cash” 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 5 9/2002 had proper justification  sufficient for the authorization of cash allocation , but all lacked documentation that  would indicate how those funds were spent. Finance Officer 1 was not able to  provide satisfactory explanations for the identifie d irregularities and had no  recollection that the ATCS Official ever made any c hecks of the financial files at  ATCS Finance Office.     11. The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 2, working at the ATCS Finance Office,  who stated he/she has been employed by the ATCS sin ce 01 April 2002. Finance  Officer 2 provided detailed information with regard  to the financial procedures and  practices at the ATCS Finance Office and indicated that based on his/her previous  experience in dealing with finances for a number of  companies (local and  international), he/she found the ATCS Finance Offic e to be “quite” disorganized.  For example, the office did not have in place prope r structures and computer  software to deal with the financial issues includin g cash, even though the amounts  of money they were processing were quite high. Fina nce Officer 2 allegedly tried to  suggest some improvements, but the ATCS Official to ld him/her that it was the way  the UNMIK wanted to deal with money and that he/she  should follow his/her  instructions. Since Finance Officer 2 was concerned  that he/she might lose his/her  job if he/she raised any further objections, he/she  decided to work as instructed by  the ATCS Official.   5 of 12     12. Finance Officer 2 was given the opportunity to review the files related to the  ATCS Official travel, where he/she also identified requests 46, 49, 55 and 59 of 2002  as lacking basic documentation on how the allocated  funds were spent. He/She was  not able to give satisfactory explanations to those  identified irregularities.     13. Finance Officer 2 was shown documentation relat ed to the travel of the ATCS  staff after 01 July 2002, when the ATCS was taken o ver by the UNMIK Pillar 4 -  KTA. Finance Officer 2 identified that the lack of documentation that was obvious  during the time period when UNMIK Pillar 2 handled Prishtina Airport, remained  the same under KTA management. Requests for cash 01 /2002; 05/2002; 06/2002;  07/2002 and 08/2002 all lacked the required documen tation of expenses.  Finance  Officer 2 stated that the ATCS Official often claim ed reimbursement for bills for food  and restaurants and he/she knew that such expenses were included in the per-diem  and that without authorisation, should not have bee n included in the claim for  reimbursement. In some cases, the expenses exceeded  several hundred Euros per  travel. The ATCS Official instructed Finance Office r 2 to file those bills and he/she  authorised them as his/her own expenditure for ‘rep resentation’.     14. Finance Officer 2 provided qualified insight wi th regard to handling of the  so-called petty cash at the ATCS Finance Office.  F inance Officer 2 said that he/she  found it very strange that there was no need for an y authorization or justification for  cash expenses of less than €500 and that ATCS staff  were regularly bringing invoices  and bills requesting reimbursement. He/She explaine d that his/her role was to  check the bill/invoice and if it was deemed to comp ly (date, sum, stamp) he/she  would reimburse the ATCS employee. Most of the so-c alled petty cash during 2002  and 2003 was spent in that fashion and it was an ex ception if the Division Manager  or the ATCS Official asked for justifications. The sums per invoice/bill paid from the  so-called petty cash were anywhere between several Euro to over €500.     15. Finance Officer 2 was also given the opportunit y to review available files  related to the so-called ATCS petty cash for any ir regularities. These bills were in  particular, €525,00  “Present for International Sta ff”; €410,00  “Present for Official 3  (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00  “Palm organizer for the ATC S Official and Official 3” and  €1.176,00  “Recharging scratch cards VALA 900 (20*2 3.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00   “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00  “Rent a car  for the ATCS Official”.  Finance Officer 2 acknowledged that there should ha ve been justification reports  filed with those invoices/bills, however, no such r eports were found in the available  documentation.  He/She further pointed out that the  ATCS Official signed the  spreadsheet and therefore he assumed responsibility  for those expenditures.    16. The ITF interviewed Official 4 at the Pristina Airport. Official 4 was requested  to review several files related to business travel of ATCS staff during 2002 and was  6 of 12   shown documents: 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2 002. He/She concluded that  all four might contain sufficient information to ju stify allocation of funds for the  planned travel of ATCS staff, however, none had suf ficient information that would  document how those allocated funds were spent. Info rmation contained in the file  46/2002 suggests that this document might have been  created after-the-fact, as had  this request been submitted for approval on 25 May 2002 (as indicated), it would be  impossible for the approval dates written on the do cument to be 21 May 2002 and 22  May 2002 respectively. Also, documents attached to request 55/2002 were printouts  indicating flight reservations, but they do not pro ve that the travel was executed.  None of the four files contained original flight ti ckets, boarding passes or original  bills, nor do they contain sufficient proof that al l the funds allocated to the travellers  were provided to them by the ATCS Official, as the travellers did not sign for them.  Without flight tickets and boarding passes it is no t sufficiently documented that the  ATCS personnel travelled on those missions.    17. Official 4 was also requested to review the fil es dated after 01 July 2002, in  particular files 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002  and 08/2002. Having studied  those files, he/she concluded that the files reveal ed the same absence of required  documentation as the other cases identified in para graph 16 above.     18. Official 4 was asked to review several files re lated to the so-called petty cash  transactions and see whether there were any irregul arities. He/She concluded that  significant efforts were made by the ATCS Official to justify the cash withdrawals,  however while the cash appeared to have been provid ed, there was very little effort  to properly document how those funds were spent.     19 ITF Investigators interviewed the Division Manag er on two occasions and  he/she explained that staff travel expenses were hi gh because of the necessity to  train nineteen air traffic controllers, seven meteo rological forecasters and six  aeronautical information service officers. All of t he above staff received classroom  and on-the-job training around the world and that P ristina Airport was responsible  for expenses incurred.  He/she said that the airpor t has no rules or regulations  regarding travel and that there are no forms to com plete requesting authorization  for travel or documentation authorizing travel. The  Division Manager was aware  that the ATCS Official, as the supervisor of many o f those who travelled, would  frequently visit staff whilst undertaking their res pective courses.     20. The Division Manager said that the ATCS Officia l would bring to him/her a  request in which he/she would detail the need for c ash and that when the Division  Manager found the justification sufficient and in l ine with needs of the Airport, he  /she would approve it. The ATCS Official would then  be responsible for the proper  use of these funds and keeping the financial record s of the expenditure. In fact, the  ATCS Official had to sign for the bank check before  it could be cashed at the bank  7 of 12   and therefore he/she had the cash in his/her “custo dy”. The Division Manager  indicated that it was not possible for him/her to c heck every bill and invoice;  therefore he /she delegated the authority for finan cial management to the ATCS  Official.     21. The ITF interviewed Official 1 at Prishtina Air port. He/She stated that in May  2002 he/she travelled with the ATCS Official and Of ficial 3 to the UK in order to  negotiate conditions and fine-tune the training arr angements for the ATCS staff  (request 46/2002). During this mission they all rec eived free accommodation, all  meals were provided as well as transport from Shinf ield Park to London upon their  return. When he/she returned to Prishtina he/she wa s not requested to return any  of the per-diem, adding that he/she knew that the A TCS Official and Official 3 also  did not return any of the allocated funds (€1158).     22. The ITF interviewed the ATCS Official on two oc casions and he/she  acknowledged that cases 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 a nd 59/2002 (the time period  up to 30 June 2002) all show numerous irregularitie s. He/she studied those files in  detail and concluded that all four contained suffic ient information to justify the  allocation of money for the planned travel of the A TCS staff, but that the  documentation of the expenses was very poor.     23. The ATCS Official also acknowledged that cases 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002;  07/2002 and 08/2002 (the time period after 01 July 2002) also showed numerous  irregularities such as missing bills to prove payme nts, missing signatures of ATCS  staff proving that they had received the per-diem, missing flight ticket and boarding  passes proving that the travel was in fact executed .  The ITF concluded that it is very  likely that those funds were paid to the ATCS emplo yees on per-diem or salaries,  however sufficient documentation to prove those pay ments was not available to the  ITF investigators despite numerous attempts made in  order to secure such  documentation. As a matter of practice, the ATCS Of ficial was formally certifying  his/her own expenses during the business trips. The  ATCS Official could not  provide any acceptable explanations to those irregu larities.      24. The ATCS Official further indicated that his/he r superiors approved all the  bills that were in the petty cash binders, includin g, for example: €525,00  “Present for  International Staff”; €410,00  “Present for Officia l 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00  “Palm  organizer for the ATCS Official and Official 3”; €1 .176,00  “Recharging scratch cards  VALA 900 (20*23.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00  “Payment  for mobile phone” and €940,00   “Rent a car for Head of Department”. The ATCS Offic ial stated that all the presents  purchased from petty cash were also approved, howev er, he/she could not support  this claim with any documentation. The ATCS Officia l added that had those bills not  been authorized, the ATCS would have not been able to get further cash as the  approval for further cash withdrawals was condition ed by proper documentation  8 of 12   and certification of previous spending. He/she insi sted that the sums paid for  refreshments/food/restaurant bills from the petty c ash fund (hundreds of Euros)  were all authorized by his/her superiors, but that they did not request written  justifications from him/her; the bill was allegedly  sufficient proof of expenditure.      25. The ATCS Official stated that in 2002, he/she w as not sufficiently  experienced in financial management, therefore he/s he hired Finance Officer 1 and  Finance Officer 2 who both had educational backgrou nd and professional  experience in this field. He/she said that he/she w as sure that the ATCS money was  spent in line with the requests, but he/she accepte d that the documentation was  very poor and unacceptable, even for the minimal st andards required.     26. The ATCS Official agreed that he/she and his/he r staff were diligent in  requesting funds for ATCS operations, however, were  generally deficient when  addressing the need for proper documentation of the  actual expenditures.     27. The ATCS Official indicated that he/she trusted  his/her staff; that they were  professional; and it was only very recently that he /she realized that he/she should  have devoted more effort to their supervision.     V. FINDINGS     28. It was established during the ITF investigation  that ATCS management  effectively ignored the potential for fraud highlig hted in the forensic audit in  2001/02.  The airport was, and continues to be, exp osed to financial wrongdoing.     29. The ITF investigation also clearly established that the oversight and internal  controls at the Prishtina Airport were and still re mains inadequate for satisfactory  monitoring and approval of expenditure.  There is n o written documentation for  authorizing travel and no standard forms for tracki ng travel-related expenses, which  are vulnerable to fraud and should be approved and monitored more closely by  management.     30. Throughout 2002 and clearly up to February 2004 , the ATCS Management, in  particular the ATCS Official, and the Division Mana ger failed to provide effective  oversight of the financial operations, especially t hose related to cash at the ATCS  Finance Office.      31. Documentation obtained by the ITF from the Pris htina Airport clearly shows  that ATCS management failed to introduce, or enforc e, rules and regulations that  would guarantee proper use of the allocated funds a nd provided transparent  documentation of this process.     9 of 12   32. A significant amount of the cash withdrawals by  the ATCS was used for  training opportunities for employees of the ATCS, w ho attended courses in a  number of countries including Italy, Canada and the  United Kingdom. Therefore,  the cash advances were not all related to the ATCS Official’s travel, rather for a  significant number of Employees. The necessity of t he frequent travel of the ATCS  Official remains questionable, as the available doc umentation does not provide clear  proof that the ATCS Official’s travel was business related or justified.     33. By way of example, ITF Investigators examined a vailable files related to  travel in 2002, which included details of staff att ending courses. This examination  was related to the situation before and also after 01 July 2002 (Note: 0n 01 July 2002  the Pristina Airport was handed over by UNMIK Pillar  2 to UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA). It  was established that at least in nine cases (46/200 2; 49/2002/55/2002; 59/2002 and  01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002; 08/2002) there were significant irregularities  related to distribution of funds, documentation and  filings of those financial records.   Having examined those listed files it was clearly e stablished that in cases: 49/2002;  55/2002; 06/2002 and 07/2002 spending of € 64435 wa s not properly documented. It  is possible that those funds were, in fact, used fo r what they had been initially  allocated. However, the documentation that was avai lable to the ITF does not  support this assumption. In case 59/2002 an overpay ment of €1810 was made  without explanation as to where the additional fund s were drawn. These findings  clearly demonstrate the disarray at the ATCS Financ e Office in 2002.     34. The ATCS financial documentation revealed that the ATCS Official was  certifying his/her own expenses for official travel . It was clearly established by the  ITF investigation that the ATCS Official made a num ber of reimbursement claims  for food and restaurant bills or refreshments that were not properly authorized.  He/she also, at least in one case, did not repay €9 9 to the petty cash fund from  request No. 01/2002. Additionally, the ATCS Officia l, Official 3 and Official 1  retained a sum of €1158 of their DSA/per-diem for a  business trip to the United  Kingdom in May 2002, even though they had been prov ided with free transport,  food and accommodation (request 46/2002).     35. In June 2002, the ATCS Official certified per-d iem of € 6975 for nine  Department 1 trainees that were supposed to partici pate in meteorology training in  the UK.  Two Department 1 staff failed their initia l examination and prematurely  returned to Prishtina. The remaining seven trainees  signed for their per-diem, in  total €5425. The ITF investigation established that  request 59/2002 does not contain  any documentation with regards to what was done wit h a sum of €1550 initially  allocated by the ATCS Official for per-diem of thos e two ATCS employees.     36. It was established that the ATCS Finance Office  used an “excel” spreadsheet  and had no alternative computerized system to deal with financial documentation.  10 of 12   The procedure used required manual inputting of det ails of individual bank  accounts into the spreadsheet before reconciling ex penditure and income against the  bank account. The system was open to abuse and was heavily reliant on individual  staff integrity.     37. The so-called ‘petty cash’ files were reviewed and it was established that the  receipts were properly filed and the figures input into the spreadsheet in most of the  cases. However, it was clearly established by the I TF investigation that during 2002,  various items were paid out of the so-called petty cash reserve without necessary  written approvals. Those items included “presents” for international and local staff  valued at several hundreds of Euros - €525,00  “Pre sent for International Staff”;  €410,00  “Present for Official 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €91 8,00  “Palm organizer for the ATCS  Official and Official 3”; €1.176,00  “Recharging sc ratch cards VALA 900 (20*23.52) +  (12*58.8)”; €960,00  “Payment for mobile phone” and  €940,00  “Rent a car for the  ATCS Official”.  Additionally bills for fuel, oil, car spare-parts often did not contain  enough information, so that there was no evidence w hether these payments were  done for official business purposes.  Since early 2 004, no cash withdrawal over €100  has been permitted, as all sums greater than that a mount have to be effected by bank  transfer and formally justified.    38. The KTA, on Official 4’s behalf, is currently u ndertaking a procurement  process in order to identify and purchase a compreh ensive automated financial  software system to replace the outdated and inadequ ate “excel” spreadsheet  currently in use. The new system will have the capa city to link all the financial  centres at the airport, including Customs.  A signi ficant delay has been experienced  within the KTA in initially progressing this procur ement, which has now, albeit  belatedly, been addressed.     39. In addition Official 4 has submitted to the KTA  Board a suggested “authority  list” that identifies authority levels for approvin g all aspects of expenditure. This  document was placed before the Airport Steering Com mittee on 16 July 2004 and  awaits ratification. Official 4 has taken active st eps to ensure that sound financial  management practices were initiated and monitored s ince her/his recruitment in  February 2004.    VI. CONCLUSION     40. UNMIK Regulation No.: 2001/27 - Essential Labou r Law in Kosovo in  paragraph 9.3. states that employees shall perform his/her obligations and may  exercise his/her rights, in accordance with the app licable law, labour contract and  where applicable collective agreement. Paragraph 11  of the same regulation states  that: quote  “11.3. Serious misconduct shall include the follow ing: … (b) theft,  destruction, damage or unauthorized use of the empl oyer’s assets; and in 11.4.  Unsatisfactory performance shall include: … (b) rep eated mistakes not sufficient in  11 of 12   themselves to justify a dismissal, but which given their frequency and seriousness  disrupt the normal course of the employment relatio nship”.    41. The investigation conducted by the ITF clearly documented that Prishtina  Airport management failed to perform their duties i n accordance with the general  principles outlined above. In particular, the use o f the assets allocated to the ATCS  by the KTA in 2002 was inadequately documented and the performance of the ATCS  Finance Office in that respect was unsatisfactory. This poor performance even  caused financial damage to the UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA , as demonstrated in this  report. The work of the ATCS Finance Office was und er direct supervision of the  ATCS Official and the oversight responsibility was in the hands of the Division  Manager. Both of them in their respectful capacity failed to perform their duties  according to expected standards and they failed to promote the best interest of  UNMIK Pillar 4 –KTA, as their employer.       VII. RECOMMENDATIONS     Recommendation 1 : In light of the established irregularities and la ck of oversight at  Prishtina Airport, UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should take  appropriate action against the  ATCS Official and the Division Manager for mismanag ement of the ATCS finances.  (IV04/049/01)    Recommendation 2:  UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that senior man agement  of Prishtina Airport comply with observations and r ecommendations provided by  external auditors. Written responses and implementa tion plans should be produced  and the management team be shown how to implement c hanges. (IV04/049/02)    Recommendation 3:  UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that all airpor t  management personnel share ownership and responsibi lity for effective financial  probity and should be reminded of this obligation.  (IV04/049/03)    Recommendation 4:  UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA  should ensure that written travel  policies and procedures should be prepared and issu ed without further delay and  should include the requirement for written approval  for all travel , including that  undertaken by senior management. This system of tra vel approvals should not  permit  airport senior staff to authorise their own travel  request and requests for  reimbursement of expenses that occurred during said  business travel. This matter  should also be brought to the attention of the airp ort’s steering committee for their  review. (IV04/049/04)    Recommendation 5:  UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that the travel  policies  should include the need for documentation to be sub mitted by those staff on official  travel, such as “boarding passes”, “ticket stubs” a nd “hotel bills” to demonstrate  evidence that travel occurred as per the approval. (IV04/049/ 05)   12 of 12     Recommendation 6 : UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that the intro duction of  new financial software should be implemented withou t further delay.  The  finalisation of this project should be monitored by  the airport steering committee.   (IV04/049/ 06)    Recommendation 7:  UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA, in collaboration with the Ai rport  Management team, shall re-evaluate all travel claim s and the funds that were not  properly accounted for the period 01 July 2002 to d ate to identify any claims without  sufficient documentation and determine what action could be taken to recover  monies involved. (IV04/049/ 07)    Recommendation 8:  The Office for Coordination of Oversight of Public ly-owned  Enterprises should monitor the implementation of th e ITF recommendations.

INTRODUCTION 1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) Kosovo, condu cted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding frequent cash withdra wals made from the bank account of Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS), Pri shtina International Airport. This investigation was triggered by a forensic audit rep ort of Public Enterprise Airport Prishtina (PEAP) and ATCS that was released in Febr uary 2003 by the Chartered Accountants. The activities of the Prishtina Airpor t fall under the control of the Kosovo Trust Agency and UNMIK Pillar IV, which is a dministered by the European Union. Investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption involving UNMIK, its pillars and other organizational structures as well as the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and independent bodies and o ffices established pursuant to the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-G overnment in Kosovo fall within the purview of ITF as laid out by the Execut ive Decision on the Establishment of the Investigation Task Force UNMIK/ED/2003/16, d ated 21 October 2003. II. APPLICABLE LAWS 2. Pursuant to the authority given to The Special R epresentative of the Secretary-General, under United Nations Security Co uncil resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999, taking into account United Nations In terim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) Regulation No. 1999/ 1 of 25 July 1999 on the Authority of the Interim Administration in Kosovo, for the purpose o f defining the law applicable in Kosovo, the SRSG promulgated that the law applicabl e in Kosovo shall be: a) The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments issued there under; and 2 of 12 b) The law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989. 3. With regards to performance and conduct of the empl oyees of KTA, the following UNMIK Regulation shall apply: UNMIK Regulation No. 2001/27, Dated 8 October 2001- On Essential Labour Law In Kosovo - Section 11- Termination of a Labour Contract, states the following ( extract ): 11.3.

Unsatisfactory performance shall include the following: (a) unjustified absence from work; and (b) repeated mistakes not sufficient in themselves to justify a dismissal, but which given their frequency and seriousness disrupt the normal course of the employment relationship. III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 4. A review of the airport’s bank accounts and docu ments related to airport operations, contracts, and financial matters reveal ed a number of cash withdrawals from the ATCS bank account, many of them in €10.000 increments. Between July 2002 and November 2003, an amount of €642.000 was w ithdrawn in cash. The majority of the withdrawals were identified as bein g for air travel and related expenses for the then the ATCS Official; similarly for other ATCS employees; and also for the so-called ‘petty cash’ purposes. The f orensic audit report of February 2003 highlighted that the ATCS Official travelled f requently and questioned whether the trips were necessary, or were approved. 5. It was established that on 01 July 2002, the new Division Manager, Airport Sector UNMIK Pillar 4 was appointed with overall re sponsibility for Prishtina Airport. The ATCS Official was in charge of the De partment, which included day- to-day management of the ATCS Finance Office. Fina nce Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 were employed as ATCS Finance Officers, b oth of them directly supervised by the ATCS Official. It should be also mentioned t hat the ATCS Official, Finance 3 of 12 Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 were working at ATC S prior to the arrival of the Division Manager. IV. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS 6. The ITF investigation was focused on the examina tion of two main areas; a) travel arrangements and cash expenses related to th e official travel of ATCS staff and b) handling of the so-called ATCS petty cash. D uring this investigation the ITF Investigators: • Reviewed existing procedures related to the cash wi thdrawals in 2002 and 2003 in view of establishing whether those procedur es were properly followed and enforced by the management of ATCS; • Examined ATCS bank account and related records; • Examined the cash withdrawal requests, supporting d ocumentation, and receipts including airline tickets, hotel bills, an d other receipts; • Reviewed the so-called petty cash files and related documentation; • Cross-checked the staff details on record and their employment roles during the time period in question, including their offici al right to authorize cash withdrawals from ATCS bank account; • Compared signatures found on the examined documents against the signatures on the staff files; • Cross-checked specific sums against the airport “ex cel” cash spreadsheets and the master bank account. (Note: the “excel” spr eadsheet system has been in place since mid-2002 and is used to maintain a “ cashbook”); • Interviewed ATCS staff, in particular the Division Manager; the ATCS Officials; and Finance Officers 1 and 2. ITF Invest igators also interviewed Official 1 at Prishtina Airport, and the Official 2 at Prishtina Airport. 7. During the review of available documentation, th e ITF investigators identified a number of problems related to the exis ting procedures and practices at ATCS Finance Office. Having finalized the document review they interviewed available ATCS staff that was directly involved in approving the cash withdrawals and subsequently ATCS staff that handled the cash a nd related documentation at 4 of 12 the ATCS Finance Office, or that travelled on train ing to Italy and the United Kingdom. 8. The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 1, working at ATCS Finance Office during the period September 2000 to December 2003. Finance Officer 1 described the procedures that were in place during 2002 and 2003 and identified Employee 1, Employee 2 and the Division Manager as “A” class si gnatories and Employee 3, Employee 4, Employee 5 and the ATCS Official as “B” class signatories for the UNMIK Aviation Transport and Airport Prishtina bank accounts. Those listed “A” class signatories were the only people authorized t o withdraw cash from the ATCS bank accounts. 9. Finance Officer 1 also confirmed that the Divisi on Manager and the ATCS Official supervised the work of the ATCS Finance Of fice. He/she further indicated that whenever there was a requirement for a larger cash payment, (for example, an official travel), Finance Officer 1 or Finance Offi cer 2 would prepare a “request for cash withdrawal” that would be signed by the ATCS O fficial and subsequently assessed and approved by the Division Manager. 10. Finance Officer 1 was given the opportunity to review documentation related to the travel of ATCS staff in 2002 prior to the ta keover of the ATCS by UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA on 1 July 2002. During this exercise , Finance Officer 1 established that “requests for cash” 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 5 9/2002 had proper justification sufficient for the authorization of cash allocation , but all lacked documentation that would indicate how those funds were spent. Finance Officer 1 was not able to provide satisfactory explanations for the identifie d irregularities and had no recollection that the ATCS Official ever made any c hecks of the financial files at ATCS Finance Office. 11. The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 2, working at the ATCS Finance Office, who stated he/she has been employed by the ATCS sin ce 01 April 2002. Finance Officer 2 provided detailed information with regard to the financial procedures and practices at the ATCS Finance Office and indicated that based on his/her previous experience in dealing with finances for a number of companies (local and international), he/she found the ATCS Finance Offic e to be “quite” disorganized. For example, the office did not have in place prope r structures and computer software to deal with the financial issues includin g cash, even though the amounts of money they were processing were quite high. Fina nce Officer 2 allegedly tried to suggest some improvements, but the ATCS Official to ld him/her that it was the way the UNMIK wanted to deal with money and that he/she should follow his/her instructions. Since Finance Officer 2 was concerned that he/she might lose his/her job if he/she raised any further objections, he/she decided to work as instructed by the ATCS Official. 5 of 12 12. Finance Officer 2 was given the opportunity to review the files related to the ATCS Official travel, where he/she also identified requests 46, 49, 55 and 59 of 2002 as lacking basic documentation on how the allocated funds were spent. He/She was not able to give satisfactory explanations to those identified irregularities. 13. Finance Officer 2 was shown documentation relat ed to the travel of the ATCS staff after 01 July 2002, when the ATCS was taken o ver by the UNMIK Pillar 4 - KTA. Finance Officer 2 identified that the lack of documentation that was obvious during the time period when UNMIK Pillar 2 handled Prishtina Airport, remained the same under KTA management. Requests for cash 01 /2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002 and 08/2002 all lacked the required documen tation of expenses. Finance Officer 2 stated that the ATCS Official often claim ed reimbursement for bills for food and restaurants and he/she knew that such expenses were included in the per-diem and that without authorisation, should not have bee n included in the claim for reimbursement. In some cases, the expenses exceeded several hundred Euros per travel. The ATCS Official instructed Finance Office r 2 to file those bills and he/she authorised them as his/her own expenditure for ‘rep resentation’. 14. Finance Officer 2 provided qualified insight wi th regard to handling of the so-called petty cash at the ATCS Finance Office. F inance Officer 2 said that he/she found it very strange that there was no need for an y authorization or justification for cash expenses of less than €500 and that ATCS staff were regularly bringing invoices and bills requesting reimbursement. He/She explaine d that his/her role was to check the bill/invoice and if it was deemed to comp ly (date, sum, stamp) he/she would reimburse the ATCS employee. Most of the so-c alled petty cash during 2002 and 2003 was spent in that fashion and it was an ex ception if the Division Manager or the ATCS Official asked for justifications. The sums per invoice/bill paid from the so-called petty cash were anywhere between several Euro to over €500. 15. Finance Officer 2 was also given the opportunit y to review available files related to the so-called ATCS petty cash for any ir regularities. These bills were in particular, €525,00 “Present for International Sta ff”; €410,00 “Present for Official 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00 “Palm organizer for the ATC S Official and Official 3” and €1.176,00 “Recharging scratch cards VALA 900 (20*2 3.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00 “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00 “Rent a car for the ATCS Official”. Finance Officer 2 acknowledged that there should ha ve been justification reports filed with those invoices/bills, however, no such r eports were found in the available documentation. He/She further pointed out that the ATCS Official signed the spreadsheet and therefore he assumed responsibility for those expenditures. 16. The ITF interviewed Official 4 at the Pristina Airport. Official 4 was requested to review several files related to business travel of ATCS staff during 2002 and was 6 of 12 shown documents: 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2 002. He/She concluded that all four might contain sufficient information to ju stify allocation of funds for the planned travel of ATCS staff, however, none had suf ficient information that would document how those allocated funds were spent. Info rmation contained in the file 46/2002 suggests that this document might have been created after-the-fact, as had this request been submitted for approval on 25 May 2002 (as indicated), it would be impossible for the approval dates written on the do cument to be 21 May 2002 and 22 May 2002 respectively. Also, documents attached to request 55/2002 were printouts indicating flight reservations, but they do not pro ve that the travel was executed. None of the four files contained original flight ti ckets, boarding passes or original bills, nor do they contain sufficient proof that al l the funds allocated to the travellers were provided to them by the ATCS Official, as the travellers did not sign for them. Without flight tickets and boarding passes it is no t sufficiently documented that the ATCS personnel travelled on those missions. 17. Official 4 was also requested to review the fil es dated after 01 July 2002, in particular files 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002 and 08/2002. Having studied those files, he/she concluded that the files reveal ed the same absence of required documentation as the other cases identified in para graph 16 above. 18. Official 4 was asked to review several files re lated to the so-called petty cash transactions and see whether there were any irregul arities. He/She concluded that significant efforts were made by the ATCS Official to justify the cash withdrawals, however while the cash appeared to have been provid ed, there was very little effort to properly document how those funds were spent. 19 ITF Investigators interviewed the Division Manag er on two occasions and he/she explained that staff travel expenses were hi gh because of the necessity to train nineteen air traffic controllers, seven meteo rological forecasters and six aeronautical information service officers. All of t he above staff received classroom and on-the-job training around the world and that P ristina Airport was responsible for expenses incurred. He/she said that the airpor t has no rules or regulations regarding travel and that there are no forms to com plete requesting authorization for travel or documentation authorizing travel. The Division Manager was aware that the ATCS Official, as the supervisor of many o f those who travelled, would frequently visit staff whilst undertaking their res pective courses. 20. The Division Manager said that the ATCS Officia l would bring to him/her a request in which he/she would detail the need for c ash and that when the Division Manager found the justification sufficient and in l ine with needs of the Airport, he /she would approve it. The ATCS Official would then be responsible for the proper use of these funds and keeping the financial record s of the expenditure. In fact, the ATCS Official had to sign for the bank check before it could be cashed at the bank 7 of 12 and therefore he/she had the cash in his/her “custo dy”. The Division Manager indicated that it was not possible for him/her to c heck every bill and invoice; therefore he /she delegated the authority for finan cial management to the ATCS Official. 21. The ITF interviewed Official 1 at Prishtina Air port. He/She stated that in May 2002 he/she travelled with the ATCS Official and Of ficial 3 to the UK in order to negotiate conditions and fine-tune the training arr angements for the ATCS staff (request 46/2002). During this mission they all rec eived free accommodation, all meals were provided as well as transport from Shinf ield Park to London upon their return. When he/she returned to Prishtina he/she wa s not requested to return any of the per-diem, adding that he/she knew that the A TCS Official and Official 3 also did not return any of the allocated funds (€1158). 22. The ITF interviewed the ATCS Official on two oc casions and he/she acknowledged that cases 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 a nd 59/2002 (the time period up to 30 June 2002) all show numerous irregularitie s. He/she studied those files in detail and concluded that all four contained suffic ient information to justify the allocation of money for the planned travel of the A TCS staff, but that the documentation of the expenses was very poor. 23. The ATCS Official also acknowledged that cases 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002 and 08/2002 (the time period after 01 July 2002) also showed numerous irregularities such as missing bills to prove payme nts, missing signatures of ATCS staff proving that they had received the per-diem, missing flight ticket and boarding passes proving that the travel was in fact executed . The ITF concluded that it is very likely that those funds were paid to the ATCS emplo yees on per-diem or salaries, however sufficient documentation to prove those pay ments was not available to the ITF investigators despite numerous attempts made in order to secure such documentation. As a matter of practice, the ATCS Of ficial was formally certifying his/her own expenses during the business trips. The ATCS Official could not provide any acceptable explanations to those irregu larities. 24. The ATCS Official further indicated that his/he r superiors approved all the bills that were in the petty cash binders, includin g, for example: €525,00 “Present for International Staff”; €410,00 “Present for Officia l 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00 “Palm organizer for the ATCS Official and Official 3”; €1 .176,00 “Recharging scratch cards VALA 900 (20*23.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00 “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00 “Rent a car for Head of Department”. The ATCS Offic ial stated that all the presents purchased from petty cash were also approved, howev er, he/she could not support this claim with any documentation. The ATCS Officia l added that had those bills not been authorized, the ATCS would have not been able to get further cash as the approval for further cash withdrawals was condition ed by proper documentation 8 of 12 and certification of previous spending. He/she insi sted that the sums paid for refreshments/food/restaurant bills from the petty c ash fund (hundreds of Euros) were all authorized by his/her superiors, but that they did not request written justifications from him/her; the bill was allegedly sufficient proof of expenditure. 25. The ATCS Official stated that in 2002, he/she w as not sufficiently experienced in financial management, therefore he/s he hired Finance Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 who both had educational backgrou nd and professional experience in this field. He/she said that he/she w as sure that the ATCS money was spent in line with the requests, but he/she accepte d that the documentation was very poor and unacceptable, even for the minimal st andards required. 26. The ATCS Official agreed that he/she and his/he r staff were diligent in requesting funds for ATCS operations, however, were generally deficient when addressing the need for proper documentation of the actual expenditures. 27. The ATCS Official indicated that he/she trusted his/her staff; that they were professional; and it was only very recently that he /she realized that he/she should have devoted more effort to their supervision. V. FINDINGS 28. It was established during the ITF investigation that ATCS management effectively ignored the potential for fraud highlig hted in the forensic audit in 2001/02. The airport was, and continues to be, exp osed to financial wrongdoing. 29. The ITF investigation also clearly established that the oversight and internal controls at the Prishtina Airport were and still re mains inadequate for satisfactory monitoring and approval of expenditure. There is n o written documentation for authorizing travel and no standard forms for tracki ng travel-related expenses, which are vulnerable to fraud and should be approved and monitored more closely by management. 30. Throughout 2002 and clearly up to February 2004 , the ATCS Management, in particular the ATCS Official, and the Division Mana ger failed to provide effective oversight of the financial operations, especially t hose related to cash at the ATCS Finance Office. 31. Documentation obtained by the ITF from the Pris htina Airport clearly shows that ATCS management failed to introduce, or enforc e, rules and regulations that would guarantee proper use of the allocated funds a nd provided transparent documentation of this process. 9 of 12 32. A significant amount of the cash withdrawals by the ATCS was used for training opportunities for employees of the ATCS, w ho attended courses in a number of countries including Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the cash advances were not all related to the ATCS Official’s travel, rather for a significant number of Employees. The necessity of t he frequent travel of the ATCS Official remains questionable, as the available doc umentation does not provide clear proof that the ATCS Official’s travel was business related or justified. 33. By way of example, ITF Investigators examined a vailable files related to travel in 2002, which included details of staff att ending courses. This examination was related to the situation before and also after 01 July 2002 (Note: 0n 01 July 2002 the Pristina Airport was handed over by UNMIK Pillar 2 to UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA). It was established that at least in nine cases (46/200 2; 49/2002/55/2002; 59/2002 and 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002; 08/2002) there were significant irregularities related to distribution of funds, documentation and filings of those financial records. Having examined those listed files it was clearly e stablished that in cases: 49/2002; 55/2002; 06/2002 and 07/2002 spending of € 64435 wa s not properly documented. It is possible that those funds were, in fact, used fo r what they had been initially allocated. However, the documentation that was avai lable to the ITF does not support this assumption. In case 59/2002 an overpay ment of €1810 was made without explanation as to where the additional fund s were drawn. These findings clearly demonstrate the disarray at the ATCS Financ e Office in 2002. 34. The ATCS financial documentation revealed that the ATCS Official was certifying his/her own expenses for official travel . It was clearly established by the ITF investigation that the ATCS Official made a num ber of reimbursement claims for food and restaurant bills or refreshments that were not properly authorized. He/she also, at least in one case, did not repay €9 9 to the petty cash fund from request No. 01/2002. Additionally, the ATCS Officia l, Official 3 and Official 1 retained a sum of €1158 of their DSA/per-diem for a business trip to the United Kingdom in May 2002, even though they had been prov ided with free transport, food and accommodation (request 46/2002). 35. In June 2002, the ATCS Official certified per-d iem of € 6975 for nine Department 1 trainees that were supposed to partici pate in meteorology training in the UK. Two Department 1 staff failed their initia l examination and prematurely returned to Prishtina. The remaining seven trainees signed for their per-diem, in total €5425. The ITF investigation established that request 59/2002 does not contain any documentation with regards to what was done wit h a sum of €1550 initially allocated by the ATCS Official for per-diem of thos e two ATCS employees. 36. It was established that the ATCS Finance Office used an “excel” spreadsheet and had no alternative computerized system to deal with financial documentation. 10 of 12 The procedure used required manual inputting of det ails of individual bank accounts into the spreadsheet before reconciling ex penditure and income against the bank account. The system was open to abuse and was heavily reliant on individual staff integrity. 37. The so-called ‘petty cash’ files were reviewed and it was established that the receipts were properly filed and the figures input into the spreadsheet in most of the cases. However, it was clearly established by the I TF investigation that during 2002, various items were paid out of the so-called petty cash reserve without necessary written approvals. Those items included “presents” for international and local staff valued at several hundreds of Euros - €525,00 “Pre sent for International Staff”; €410,00 “Present for Official 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €91 8,00 “Palm organizer for the ATCS Official and Official 3”; €1.176,00 “Recharging sc ratch cards VALA 900 (20*23.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00 “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00 “Rent a car for the ATCS Official”. Additionally bills for fuel, oil, car spare-parts often did not contain enough information, so that there was no evidence w hether these payments were done for official business purposes. Since early 2 004, no cash withdrawal over €100 has been permitted, as all sums greater than that a mount have to be effected by bank transfer and formally justified. 38. The KTA, on Official 4’s behalf, is currently u ndertaking a procurement process in order to identify and purchase a compreh ensive automated financial software system to replace the outdated and inadequ ate “excel” spreadsheet currently in use. The new system will have the capa city to link all the financial centres at the airport, including Customs. A signi ficant delay has been experienced within the KTA in initially progressing this procur ement, which has now, albeit belatedly, been addressed. 39. In addition Official 4 has submitted to the KTA Board a suggested “authority list” that identifies authority levels for approvin g all aspects of expenditure. This document was placed before the Airport Steering Com mittee on 16 July 2004 and awaits ratification. Official 4 has taken active st eps to ensure that sound financial management practices were initiated and monitored s ince her/his recruitment in February 2004. VI. CONCLUSION 40. UNMIK Regulation No.: 2001/27 - Essential Labou r Law in Kosovo in paragraph 9.3. states that employees shall perform his/her obligations and may exercise his/her rights, in accordance with the app licable law, labour contract and where applicable collective agreement. Paragraph 11 of the same regulation states that: quote “11.3. Serious misconduct shall include the follow ing: … (b) theft, destruction, damage or unauthorized use of the empl oyer’s assets; and in 11.4. Unsatisfactory performance shall include: … (b) rep eated mistakes not sufficient in 11 of 12 themselves to justify a dismissal, but which given their frequency and seriousness disrupt the normal course of the employment relatio nship”. 41. The investigation conducted by the ITF clearly documented that Prishtina Airport management failed to perform their duties i n accordance with the general principles outlined above. In particular, the use o f the assets allocated to the ATCS by the KTA in 2002 was inadequately documented and the performance of the ATCS Finance Office in that respect was unsatisfactory. This poor performance even caused financial damage to the UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA , as demonstrated in this report. The work of the ATCS Finance Office was und er direct supervision of the ATCS Official and the oversight responsibility was in the hands of the Division Manager. Both of them in their respectful capacity failed to perform their duties according to expected standards and they failed to promote the best interest of UNMIK Pillar 4 –KTA, as their employer. VII. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1 : In light of the established irregularities and la ck of oversight at Prishtina Airport, UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should take appropriate action against the ATCS Official and the Division Manager for mismanag ement of the ATCS finances. (IV04/049/01) Recommendation 2: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that senior man agement of Prishtina Airport comply with observations and r ecommendations provided by external auditors. Written responses and implementa tion plans should be produced and the management team be shown how to implement c hanges. (IV04/049/02) Recommendation 3: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that all airpor t management personnel share ownership and responsibi lity for effective financial probity and should be reminded of this obligation. (IV04/049/03) Recommendation 4: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that written travel policies and procedures should be prepared and issu ed without further delay and should include the requirement for written approval for all travel , including that undertaken by senior management. This system of tra vel approvals should not permit airport senior staff to authorise their own travel request and requests for reimbursement of expenses that occurred during said business travel. This matter should also be brought to the attention of the airp ort’s steering committee for their review. (IV04/049/04) Recommendation 5: UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that the travel policies should include the need for documentation to be sub mitted by those staff on official travel, such as “boarding passes”, “ticket stubs” a nd “hotel bills” to demonstrate evidence that travel occurred as per the approval. (IV04/049/ 05) 12 of 12 Recommendation 6 : UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA should ensure that the intro duction of new financial software should be implemented withou t further delay. The finalisation of this project should be monitored by the airport steering committee.

INTRODUCTION    1.  This report deals with a case of cheque fraud which  was investigated by the Investigations  Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Servic es (ID/OIOS) between October 2003 and  March 2005.     2.  The United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON) reported to  ID/OIOS that the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Bratislava, S lovakia had made payments to an  individual based on falsified documents for a total  of US$10,079. Although the investigation did  not establish who perpetrated the fraud, it was abl e to establish how the fraud was committed.  The investigation also examined certain aspects of the control systems found within the finance  office, UNDP Bratislava, where the fraud occurred.     3.  This report provides a description of the evidence collected by the ID/OIOS Investigators,  the findings, and makes a number of recommendations  to assist management in preventing this  type of fraud.     II. ISSUES    4.  Can the fraudulently induced payments be recouped?    5.  Was this fraud facilitated by a United Nations staf f member and, if so, can that individual  be identified?    III.

Fraud under Slovakian Criminal Code, 1961: Article 250, from Act 140 of the 1961  Slovakian Criminal Code whereby - “any person who d oes harm to the property of others or  enriches himself….... and causes harm or damage is guilty of fraud” IV. BACKGROUND    11.  Per agreements between UNDP, UNHQ and UNON, UNDP country  offices provide a  range of administrative services, including cash di sbursements, related to programme  implementation for United Nations agencies.  The UNDP  country offices record the layout of  funds on Inter Office Vouchers (IOV) and bill the v arious agencies for these services on a  monthly basis by preparing a Report AT 036 for each  agency, which has appended to it copies of  all IOVs for that agency for the month.  The origin al AT 036 report and its attachments are sent  to UNDP HQ New York by diplomatic pouch and a copy is  sent to the agency. Report AT 036 is  thereafter filed in the UNDP country finance files.  In UNDP Bratislava, copies are not kept of  the attachments and the Report AT 036 does not enum erate them.  This office processes about 25  cash disbursements a month.    12.  In October 2003, UNON Finance was reconciling its acc ounts with UNDP Bratislava and  noted there was an outstanding IOV from August 2002 .  UNON Finance could not locate the  August 2002 Report AT 036 or its attachments.  It r equested these materials from UNDP  Bratislava and determined that there were two cash disbursement vouchers which could not be  reconciled:  two lump sum payments to The Consultan t, in the amounts of US$5,814 and  US$4,265, for travel to Johannesburg and Monrovia t o attend Ozone Secretariat conferences in  August 2002 and September 2002 respectively.      13.  UNON finance determined that these two vouchers were based on a genuine travel  request authorization which had been sent from UNON to the UNDP Bratislava office on 25  June 2002.  The two travel requests of The Consulta nt changed certain details of the genuine fax,  including the name of the payee, the date, comments  and the UNON fax number which is unique  to each UNON fax and is assigned in the UNON cable room , but retained, amongst other items,  the names and signatures of the authorizing officer s, and the Travel Request number, which is  specific to each request.    14.  UNON finance concluded that the faxes which instructe d UNDP Bratislava to make these  payments were forged. Furthermore, UNEP confirmed th at there were no meetings in  Johannesburg and Monrovia in 2002, that The Consult ant was not UNEP’s consultant, and that  payment of lump sums to consultants for travel was irregular in any event.     V. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS  15.  ID/OIOS learned that the genuine and the forged fax es were received by the registry clerk  of the UNDP Bratislava registry office and, in the normal course of business, forwarded by email  to The Finance Department Supervisor, and to Financ e Assistant 1.  The Finance Department  Supervisor then forwarded the genuine fax to the tr avel department for processing, but neither  The Finance Department Supervisor nor Finance Assis tant 1 forwarded the forged faxes  elsewhere.    16.  Finance Assistant 1 then emailed “The Consultant” o n both occasions to notify him of the  authorization of payment and he and “The Consultant ” exchanged emails to arrange the time and  means of his collection of the payment.  On both oc casions “The Consultant” presented himself  at the UNDP office.  On one occasion, he logged in with his signature and identification number, but there was no sign-in record the other time.  “T he Consultant” met with someone from the  finance department, probably Finance Assistant 1, a lthough Finance Assistant 1 has no  recollection of meeting him. In keeping with accept ed practice within UNDP Bratislava and  Slovakia as a whole, whoever met with “The Consulta nt” had him write his name and identity  details on the back of the respective checks. Howev er, UNDP Bratislava does not keep an  independent copy of such information.  “The Consult ant” also signed a cash disbursement form  and subsequently cashed both checks.  17.  ID/OIOS obtained copies of the checks from the bank  and acquired the identity details  from the back of the check.  ID/OIOS consulted with  the Slovakian police and found that neither  “The Consultant” nor his company were in their data bases and the police concluded that the  identity materials provided by him when he picked u p the checks were likely to be false.  ID/OIOS also found that the email account used by “ The Consultant” to arrange collection of the  cheques at UNDP Bratislava had been discontinued.    18.  ID/OIOS examined copies of the forged faxes which h ad been retained in the UNDP  Bratislava registry database.  These copies had a h eader with UNON’s sender details, but unlike  the UNDP Bratislava hard copies in the finance files  and those which had been forwarded to  UNON in October 2003, the registry copies also had a  footer which reflected that they had  actually been sent from a store which provides fax services in a shopping centre near the UNDP  Bratislava office.    19.  Finance Assistant 1 claimed he had not noticed the footer on them.  When ID/OIOS asked  why the photocopies of the forged faxes in the UNDP finance file did not have the footer, he  disclaimed responsibility for the photocopying.    20.  At the time of these incidents, two photocopying as sistants had been working on an ad  hoc basis at the finance office and had access to d epartmental files.  Photocopying Assistant 1  was a relative of The Finance Department Supervisor , and Photocopying Assistant 2, was the  daughter of Finance Assistant 2.  Photocopying Assi stant 2 assisted her father periodically  without pay.  OIOS was informed that the two assist ants helped in the preparation of the end of  month financial returns, which included retrieving documents from various files, copying them  and returning them to the files.  Photocopying Assi stant 1 was working at the finance office at the  relevant time period, but it has not been fully est ablished when Photocopying Assistant 2 worked  at the office.  No timesheets were kept for either assistant.    21.  Review of procedures at UNON, UNEP Narobi and UNDP Brati slava in connection with  payments of this sort showed that   • UNDP Bratislava relies on the authorizing signature s on the faxes and does not verify their  authenticity with the agency;  • UNDP Bratislava maintains a sign-in sheet which req uires a signature and identity  information, but it was kept haphazardly at the tim e of these incidents; • UNDP Bratislava disperses cheques upon proof of ide ntity, which is recorded on the back of  the cheque, and the payee signs the original cash d isbursement voucher upon receipt of the  cheque, but the finance office does not retain a co py of the payee’s proof of identification;  • UNDP Bratislava does not maintain a mail log;  • While procedures for reconciling accounts between U NON and UNDP were in place, UNON  did not attempt to reconcile the August 2002 UNDP Br atislava  account for more than a year  after it was purportedly submitted; and  • UNEP Narobi stated that it has had several problems with fraudulent payments by UNDP  offices.  VI. FINDINGS    Issue One:  Can the fraudulently induced payments b e recovered from The Consultant?  22.  ID/OIOS, with the assistance of the Slovakia police , has not been able to ascertain the  identity of “The Consultant.”  However, “The Consul tant,” if identified and found, would be  subject to prosecution under the Slovakian penal co de.    Issue Two:  Was this fraud facilitated by a United Nations staff member and, if so, can that  individual be identified?  23.  ID/OIOS has established that the genuine UNON fax num ber was photocopied and  altered to produce The Consultant’s fax requests.  It has also established that the forged faxes  were transmitted locally, which suggests that this fraud was carried out in Slovakia.    24.  Whoever forged the faxes had to have access to the genuine fax and knowledge of the  format and function of the travel requests and the procedures used in processing these requests.    25.  The fact that UNON finance did not receive the Repor t AT 036 and the appended IOV  although the cover letter to UNON was filed at UNDP Br atislava, suggests that someone with  knowledge and access manipulated the system to dela y discovery of the fraud.  Furthermore, the  photocopies of the forged faxes which were filed wi th the Report AT 036 were copied without  the identifying footer, which also suggests an inte nt to delay discovery of the fraud.    26.  Consequently, it is highly probable that this fraud  was facilitated by a UNDP Bratislava  staff member, probably in the finance department, b ut ID/OIOS Investigators were not able to  determine who was responsible.    27.  If a staff member is found to have facilitated this  fraud, he could be charged with  violation of Staff Rule 101.2(g), Staff Regulation 1.2(b), (g) and (i), and would be subject to  prosecution under the Slovakian penal code.    VII. RECOMMENDATIONS    28.  In the light of the preceding findings and con clusions, OIOS makes the following  recommendations:   Recommendation 1:  It is recommended that UNDP revis e the system in place for verification  and payment of travel authorization requests to enh ance and safeguard procedures and prevent  fraud. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/01)  Recommendation 2:  It is recommended that UNDP Brati slava retain copies of identification  provided by payees to assist in later identity chec k requirements. (Rec. No.  IV/03/580/02)  Recommendation 3:  It is recommended that UNDP Brati slava avoid nepotism and maintain  proper records time and pay records for part time e mployees. (Rec. No. IV/03/580/03)  Recommendation 4:  It is recommended that all Agenc ies utilizing the services of UNDP use the  Atlas electronic payment and financial accounts sys tem which checks the authenticity of an  authorization and creates an electronic log of even ts.  (Rec. No. IV/03/580/04)  Recommendation 5: It is recommended that the United  Nations establish a secure intranet  website for travel claims which would permit author ization levels for receiving and making  payments, and offer a built in electronic audit tra cking facility.  (Rec. No. IV/03/580/05)  Recommendation 6:  It is recommended that UNDP reque st the Slovakian Police to investigate  this matter. (Rec.

The Investigations Division of the Office of Intern al  Oversight Services (OIOS) received several emails s ent to  persons external to the Organization, which alleged  that  wrongdoings were committed at the Economic Commissi on for Africa  (ECA) but no action was taken.  One of the authors of the said  emails was a staff member of ECA.    2.  Subsequently, an investigation was conducted that r evealed  that contrary to UN Rules and Regulations, the staf f member sent  emails to His Excellency, Ambassador John Negropont e of the US  Mission to the UN, the President and Vice-President  of the  United States of America, Senator John Kerry and Se nator Dodd of  the United States Senate amongst others.       II.   APPLICABLE LAW    3.  Regulation 1.2 (i)  of the Staff Regulations provides that   “Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion  with regard  to all matters of official business.  They shall no t communicate  to any Government, entity, person or any other sour ce any  information known to them by reason of their offici al position  that they know or ought to have known has not been made public,  except as appropriate in the normal course of their  duties or by  authorization of the Secretary-General.  These obli gations do  not cease upon separation from service”.      III.   METHODOLOGY    4.  OIOS investigation of this matter entailed obtainin g and  analyzing relevant documents. Staff members were al so  interviewed including the staff member.      IV.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION    5.  The staff member worked in ECA at the P5 level.  He  retired  at the end of November 2003 having worked for the O rganization  for over 25 years.                        4 V.   INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS    A.   “Hiwot Abebe” email of 26 January 2003    6.  During the course of the investigation, it was reve aled  that on 26 January 2003, an anonymous person, using  the  identities of “Hiwot Abebe” sent an email to the Pr esident and  Vice-President of the United States of America.  Th e email was  also addressed to Senator John Kerry and Senator Do dd of the  United States Senate.  The email had an attachment that was  addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and hig hlighted  allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrat ed by some  senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex.  Th e title to  the attachment was “Crimes of Rape and Maladministr ation within  the compound of ECA”.  The document was also copied  to the  Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and s enior  officials in the UN System.    7.  “Abebe’s” complaint to the American Government was that the  Executive Secretary, ECA had failed to take action against staff  members who were alleged to have sexually harassed and raped ten  women staff members of ECA.  “Abebe” was therefore asking the  American Government to intervene on behalf of the a ggrieved  women.    8.  The above email and the attachment were copied to t he staff  member and other persons working in the Organizatio n.    B.   Email submitted by the staff member to   Ambassador Negroponte   and US Government Officials    9.  On 28 January 2003, the staff member wrote an email  to His  Excellency, Ambassador John Negroponte of the US Mi ssion to the  UN and “Hiwot”.  He also copied the email to the Pr esident and  Vice - President of the United States of America, S enator John  Kerry and Senator Dodd of the United States Senate.   In  addition, he attached to the email the document all eging rape  and sexual harassment by some officials of ECA - “C rimes of Rape  and Maladministration within the compound of ECA”.  On the same  day White House responded and thanked the staff mem ber for  emailing President Bush and Vice - President Cheney .                    10.  In his email to Ambassador Negroponte, the staff me mber  informed him that the aggrieved staff members had e xhausted all  avenues available for recourse under the UN justice  system.  The  staff member therefore appealed to Ambassador Negro ponte to                5 intervene by drawing this to the attention of the S ecretary- General.     C.   Interview of the staff member    11.  In his interview with the Investigators, the staff member  initially denied sending the email and the attachme nt in  question to Ambassador Negroponte and other persons  outside the  UN System.  Later he conceded that he wrote to the Ambassador in  his capacity as a staff representative after the ag grieved staff  members approached him for assistance.    12.  The staff member stated that there were ten women s taff  members who were victims of sexual harassment at EC A.  When the  Investigators requested the staff member to provide  the names of  the ten women staff members, he refused to do so .   He stated that  he was actually told about the allegations by a Sta ff Union  member who confided to him that the allegations wer e true.  The  staff member refused to disclose the name of the st aff member to  the Investigators.    13.  When the staff member was asked why he sought assis tance  from Ambassador Negroponte, a non-UN staff member, his response  was that the aggrieved staff members who were worki ng as a group  felt that the issue was taking a long time to resol ve;  therefore, he decided to appeal to Ambassador Negro ponte.  He  said that he did not consult ECA management before writing to  persons outside the Organization as the ECA interna l justice  system seemed to have collapsed.  He said that his conscience  was clear that sexual harassment did happen and tha t was why he  had intervened on behalf of the female staff member s.    14.  The staff member stated that the sexual harassment issue  was raised and addressed at several staff and manag ement  meetings by the Executive Secretary.  In this conne ction, on 18  March 2003, the Executive Secretary wrote a memoran dum to the  Officer-in-Charge, OHRM responding to all the alleg ations  leveled against the management of ECA.  On the alle gation of  sexual harassment, the Executive Secretary conclude d by stating  that it was “totally unfounded and simply ridiculou s and  preposterous”.                      D.   Emails by the staff member to Mr. Mzumara, OIC , SRO, Lusaka     15.  On 29 January 2003, the staff member wrote an email  to Mr.  Dickson Mzumara, Officer-in-Charge of the ECA Sub R egional  Office in Lusaka, Zambia confirming that he had wri tten to  Ambassador Negroponte because he had had a chat wit h friends who                6 thought that “this was too much of a hot potato”.  Mr. Mzumara  was also a recipient of a copy of the email that wa s addressed  to Ambassador Negroponte by the staff member.    16.  On the same day, Mr. Mzumara replied through an ema il to  the staff member and concurred with his action of w riting to the  Ambassador.  However, Mr. Mzumara pointed out to th e staff  member that he was concerned that he, the staff mem ber, was  writing to persons outside the Organization.  Mr. M zumara stated  that “Yes I thought as much.  My concern was you we re going out  of the system and this is not in line with the Cond itions of  Service.  See what comes out of it”.  The staff mem ber responded  via email dated 29 January 2003 and stated that, “T hanks that I  have been told.  This question was brought in the J AB in  Nairobi.  With a few phone calls, the case was shel ved.  The  lady who broadcasted the message is the one who wro te to White  House and the Vice Presidents of the USA.  If the i nternal  justice system had functioned every thing would hav e been kept  within the system.  My hope was Negroponte being in  the UN  Secretariat would do damage control and get somehow  the Boss to  address the problem, in the best interest of the Se cretary  General.  The ladies will continue writing to Human  Rights  Organizations, especially those that are fired.  It  may not  produce immediate results but a lot of damage will be done”.  He  added that he wrote to the Ambassador “to show the man that  dialogue is the best option in life”.    E.   Interview with Mr. Dickson Mzumara     17.  Mr. Mzumara recalled that in January 2003, the conc erned  staff member who retired in November 2003 wrote to US Ambassador  Negroponte concerning grievances of sexual harassme nt at ECA.   He said that after he received a copy of that commu nication  through email, he wrote to the staff member and adv ised him that  it was contrary to UN Regulations for him to commun icate with  persons external to the Organization.  In connectio n with this  communication, Mr. Mzumara advised the staff member  to tender a  letter of resignation.    F.   Allegations of Sexual Harrassment    18.  The allegation of sexual harassment made by one of the  female staff members named in the anonymous letters  was  investigated by OIOS/ID.  She had complained that h er contract  was terminated after she had turned down the sexual  advances of  a manager.                  7 19.  The female staff member informed OIOS that during a n office  retreat held at the Nazareth Restaurant in 2001, th e manager was  at the coffee shop with two other staff members, Mr . Oluwatete  Olokodana, Deputy Chief of Security and Mr. Vintzis lav Stokykov,  Chief, Facilities Management Section, when the mana ger  approached her saying, “why are you wearing this, i t’s too hot  here”. Whilst saying this he put his hand on her T- shirt and  tried to look and touch her breast.     20.  When interviewed, Mr. Olokodana said that he did no t  witness any sexual harassment at the retreat. Howev er, in the  presence of Mr. Stoykov, he recalled that the femal e staff  member complained to the manager that she was not f eeling well  whilst they were having lunch.     21.  OIOS interviewed Mr. Stoykov who said that such an incident  did not occur. However, he recalled the female staf f member  being in the company of the manager, Mr. Olokodana and himself  when she came to complain that she had flu whilst t hey were  having coffee.    22.  The manager told OIOS that he did not sexually hara ss the  female staff member and that such allegations are m ade when  staff members are dissatisfied with certain manager ial  decisions.  He said that the female staff member’s contract was  terminated because her performance was poor.    23.  When the female staff member was re-interviewed by ID/OIOS,  she maintained that she had been sexually harassed.  When asked  why she had not engaged the various possible intern al systems,  including OHRMS to have the issue resolved, she sta ted that she  had not pursued the issue because she did not know how to  approach it. The female staff member explained that  she thinks  that her contract was not renewed because of the se xual  harassment. The female staff member left the employ ment of ECA  some two years ago and has never taken any steps to  engage any  United Nations system options to pursue her complai nt.    24.  In light of the above, there is therefore insuffici ent  evidence to support the female staff member’s alleg ation of  sexual harassment.  Both Mr. Olokodana and Mr. Stoy kov whom she  claimed witnessed the incident deny that any incide nt occurred  and reported a substantially different exchange.    25.  Ms. Bongoy – Mawalla, Chief General Services Sectio n  explained to OIOS that she was the focal point for women until  July 2003.  She said that during her tenure, she is sued a                8 circular to create awareness about sexual harassmen t but no  incident was reported by staff members.    26.  During interviews with OIOS, Mr. Ali Todaro, Specia l  Assistant to the Executive Secretary also denied se xually  harassing women staff members at ECA as alleged in the anonymous  emails.  Because those women were not named and the  staff member  refused to identify them to ID/OIOS, it was not pos sible to  further pursue the allegations.      VI.  EVIDENCE, FINDINGS OF FACT    27.  As indicated above, Staff Regulation 1.2 (i) stipul ates  that staff members shall not communicate to any Gov ernment,  entity, person or any other source any official inf ormation that  they know has not been made public except as approp riate in the  normal course of their duties or by authorization b y the  Secretary General.  These obligations do not cease upon  separation from service.    28.  Email messages sent to US Ambassador Negroponte, Pr esident  Bush, Vice President Cheney, Senators and other per sons external  to the Organization by The staff member is a contra vention of  the above Staff Regulation.  The reason for so doin g –  especially in light of his refusal to identify the sources of  the complaints he was ostensibly raising to the OIO S  Investigators when asked – appears evident in The s taff member’s  reply to Mr. Mzumara who told him his actions contr avened Staff  Regulations.  The staff member had at the time indi cated that,   “ ----- if the internal justice system had function ed every  thing would have been kept within the system.  My h ope was  Negroponte being in the UN Secretariat would do dam age control  and get somehow the Boss to address the problem, in  the best  interest of the Secretary General.  The ladies will  continue  writing to Human Rights Organizations, especially t hose that are  fired.  It may not produce immediate results but a lot of damage  will be done”.                                29.  During interviews with the OIOS Investigators, by h is own  admission, the staff member confirmed communicating  to persons  outside the Organization.  He did not inform ECA ma nagement  arguing that the ECA internal justice system had co llapsed.   However, he knew that the matter was being dealt wi th by the  Executive Secretary as confirmed by him during his interview  with the Investigators.                    9     VII.   CONCLUSION    30.  In light of the above findings, it is evident that the  staff member contravened Staff Regulation 1.2 (i).  He sought  intervention from US Ambassador Negroponte and othe r persons who  were external to the Organization.  Further, the st aff member  disseminated emails that he knew were not to be mad e public  without authorization from the Secretary-General.      VIII.   RECOMMENDATIONS     Recommendation 1     It is recommended that this investigation report be  placed in  the staff member’s Personnel Status File; (ID Rec. No.  IV03/570/01)    Recommendation 2     It is recommended that Office of Legal Affairs (OLA ) send to the  staff member a cease and desist letter pointing out  that though  separated from the Organization he has an obligatio n not to  disseminate official UN information as provided for  in  Regulation 1.2(i) of the Staff Regulations “Staff m embers shall  exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all m atters of  official business.  They shall not communicate to a ny  Government, entity, person or any other source any information  known to them by reason of their official position that they  know or ought to have known has not been made publi c, except as  appropriate in the normal course of their duties or  by  authorization of the Secretary-General.

When asked why she had not engaged the various possible intern al systems, including OHRMS to have the issue resolved, she sta ted that she had not pursued the issue because she did not know how to approach it. The female staff member explained that she thinks that her contract was not renewed because of the se xual harassment. The female staff member left the employ ment of ECA some two years ago and has never taken any steps to engage any United Nations system options to pursue her complai nt. 24. In light of the above, there is therefore insuffici ent evidence to support the female staff member’s alleg ation of sexual harassment. Both Mr. Olokodana and Mr. Stoy kov whom she claimed witnessed the incident deny that any incide nt occurred and reported a substantially different exchange. 25. Ms. Bongoy – Mawalla, Chief General Services Sectio n explained to OIOS that she was the focal point for women until July 2003. She said that during her tenure, she is sued a 8 circular to create awareness about sexual harassmen t but no incident was reported by staff members. 26. During interviews with OIOS, Mr. Ali Todaro, Specia l Assistant to the Executive Secretary also denied se xually harassing women staff members at ECA as alleged in the anonymous emails. Because those women were not named and the staff member refused to identify them to ID/OIOS, it was not pos sible to further pursue the allegations. VI. EVIDENCE, FINDINGS OF FACT 27. As indicated above, Staff Regulation 1.2 (i) stipul ates that staff members shall not communicate to any Gov ernment, entity, person or any other source any official inf ormation that they know has not been made public except as approp riate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization b y the Secretary General. These obligations do not cease upon separation from service. 28. Email messages sent to US Ambassador Negroponte, Pr esident Bush, Vice President Cheney, Senators and other per sons external to the Organization by The staff member is a contra vention of the above Staff Regulation. The reason for so doin g – especially in light of his refusal to identify the sources of the complaints he was ostensibly raising to the OIO S Investigators when asked – appears evident in The s taff member’s reply to Mr. Mzumara who told him his actions contr avened Staff Regulations. The staff member had at the time indi cated that, “ ----- if the internal justice system had function ed every thing would have been kept within the system. My h ope was Negroponte being in the UN Secretariat would do dam age control and get somehow the Boss to address the problem, in the best interest of the Secretary General. The ladies will continue writing to Human Rights Organizations, especially t hose that are fired. It may not produce immediate results but a lot of damage will be done”. 29. During interviews with the OIOS Investigators, by h is own admission, the staff member confirmed communicating to persons outside the Organization. He did not inform ECA ma nagement arguing that the ECA internal justice system had co llapsed. However, he knew that the matter was being dealt wi th by the Executive Secretary as confirmed by him during his interview with the Investigators. 9 VII. CONCLUSION 30. In light of the above findings, it is evident that the staff member contravened Staff Regulation 1.2 (i). He sought intervention from US Ambassador Negroponte and othe r persons who were external to the Organization. Further, the st aff member disseminated emails that he knew were not to be mad e public without authorization from the Secretary-General. VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1 It is recommended that this investigation report be placed in the staff member’s Personnel Status File; (ID Rec. No. IV03/570/01) Recommendation 2 It is recommended that Office of Legal Affairs (OLA ) send to the staff member a cease and desist letter pointing out that though separated from the Organization he has an obligatio n not to disseminate official UN information as provided for in Regulation 1.2(i) of the Staff Regulations “Staff m embers shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all m atters of official business. They shall not communicate to a ny Government, entity, person or any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has not been made publi c, except as appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary-General. These obli gations do not cease upon separation from service”. ID Rec.

The Investigations Division, Office of Internal Ove rsight Services (ID/OIOS)  received a complaint that an Economic Commission of  Africa (ECA) staff member  misappropriated the sum of US$12,000 that was inten ded as Daily Subsistence  Allowance (DSA) for five participants attending a c onference in Seychelles. This  complaint, received in 2001 some two years after th e alleged commission of the  misappropriation, did not provide the name of the c onference, when it was held, or the  name of the subject. In the course of its prelimina ry investigation, soon after receipt of  this matter, ID/OIOS learned that the complainant n o longer worked at ECA and was  inaccessible through other contact numbers given to  ID/OIOS. In spite of these  difficulties however, ID/OIOS subsequently investig ated this case during one of its ECA  missions when it found time to do so for the purpos e of ascertaining whether the theft  could be corroborated and if so, identifying the pe rpetrator and any system weaknesses.       II.  APPLICABLE  LAWS    2. Staff Regulation 1.2 (g)     Staff members shall not use their office or knowled ge gained from their official functions  for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for th e private gain of any third party,  including family, friends and those they favour.  No r shall staff members use their office  for personal reasons to prejudice the positions of those they do not favour.     3. Financial Rule 104.9 (ST/SGB/2003/7)     Officials to whom cash advances are issued shall be  held personally accountable and  financially liable for the proper management and sa fekeeping of cash so advanced and  must be in a position to account for these advances  at all times. They shall submit  monthly accounts unless otherwise directed by the U nder-Secretary-General for  Management.    4. Financial Rule 104.10 (ST/SGB/2003/7)     (b) Disbursements shall be recorded in the accounts  as at the date on which they  are made, that is, when the cheque is issued, trans fer is effected or cash is paid out.    (c) Except where a paid cheque is returned by the b ank or a debit advice is  received from the bank, a payee’s written receipt s hall be obtained for all  disbursements.            4   III.  METHODOLOGY    5. ID/OIOS interviewed the ACGD Officer, ECA’s Officia l 1, and other staff  members. Investigators also obtained and analyzed d ocuments including personnel  records, bank records and the list of participants for the Seychelles conference  indicating who was paid DSA.      IV. BACKGROUND  INFORMATION     6. ID/OIOS determined that the conference in question was “An Eastern and  Southern Africa Sub Regional Meeting” and was held from 15 to 18 February, 1999 at  the Berjaja Mahe Beach Resort Hotel in Victoria, Se ychelles. It was organized by the  African Centre for Women (ACW), now the African Cen tre for Gender Development  (ACGD).     7. This conference attracted over 100 participants,  46 of whom were sponsored by  ECA. The rest were sponsored by other international  organizations.    8. When ECA finances a conference, a list of participa nts is prepared and then a  travel request (a “PT.8”) is prepared for each part icipant. The PT.8 is certified by the  Director of the Division and sent to the Finance Di vision, which verifies that the correct  account number is quoted and that there is sufficie nt money to honor the request. It is  then recorded in the Integrated Management Informat ion System (IMIS), which  demonstrates approval of the request.  A letter to UNDP referencing the PT.8 number and  account number is prepared and the Finance Division  approves that letter before it is sent  to UNDP for payment to be made to the attendee.     9. Typically when ECA sponsors a conference, it arrang es with the UNDP office in  the country in which the conference is held to pay DSA to participants. However, there  was no UNDP office in the Seychelles. Consequently the airfares and 50 per cent of DSA  were paid to participants by UNDP offices in each p articipant’s country and the ACGD  Officer was entrusted with the payment of the remai ning 50 per cent of DSA to  participants while they were at the conference.  Wh en UNDP makes its payments, it  sends an inter-office voucher (IOV) to ECA indicati ng the amount of money they have  spent and ECA reimburses UNDP. If the DSA was not pa id and ticket not issued by  UNDP, then an IOV credit is sent to the Finance Div ision. Cancellation of a PT.8  indicates that that person did not attend the confe rence, and the UNDP office in question  would then issue an IOV credit to ECA.        V. INVESTIGATIVE  DETAILS    10. In an inter-office memorandum dated 19 January 2000 , Official 3 asked the  ACGD Officer to settle relevant claims and to provi de supporting documentation for the  5 US$49,000 the ACGD Officer had received for payment  of DSA and other miscellaneous  expenses at the conference.  In a subsequent inter- office memorandum dated 17 February  2000, Official 4 specifically questioned the paymen t of DSA to five people who had  apparently not attended the 1999 Seychelles confere nce.      11. ID/OIOS Investigators observed that of the five PT. 8 reference numbers referred  to by Official 4 in his memorandum of 17 February 2 000, one was repeated and another  PT.8 had in fact not been cancelled, leaving three rather than five apparently  inappropriately disbursed DSA payments in the amoun t of US$3,011. The attendance list  showed that the PT.8’s in question were for Partici pant 1, Participant 2 and Participant 3.    12. ID/OIOS obtained the following documentation for th e money disbursed to the  ACGD Officer for the payment of DSA.     (a) Official 5 authorized Official 6 to pay the ACGD Of ficer the sum of  US$40,000: US$35,000 for the remaining half of the DSA to be paid to the conference  participants and US$5,000 for miscellaneous expense s.    (b) Official 5 authorized the payment of a further sum of US$9,000 to the  ACGD Officer for DSA to be paid to the conference p articipants.    13. Receipt of payment of US$49,000 was confirmed as fo llows:    (a) Advice notes from Barclays Bank PLC Independenc e Square (“Barclays”)  confirm that US$49,300 was paid to the ACGD Officer . Barclays overpaid the ACGD  Officer US$300 and debited this amount from UNDP’s a ccount.    (b) A letter dated 8 March 2000 from Official 7 of UNDP office in Mauritius,  confirmed that the ACGD Officer received US$49,000:  US$44,000 of which was to pay  50 per cent DSA to participants.     14.      In an inter-office memorandum dated 18 Februar y 2000, both Official 2 and the  ACGD Officer responded to Official 4’s 17 February 2000 inquiry of payment of DSA to  persons whose PT.8’s were cancelled and had not att ended the conference. Official 2  stated that the funds transferred to Seychelles by ECA were managed by herself, the  ACGD Officer and the UNDP Officer in Port Louis, Sey chelles. She further stated that  the amount transferred to pay the remaining 50 per cent of DSA was only made available  after the end of the conference, which created chao s in paying participants before their  departures. In addition, Barclays did not have suff icient smaller US denominations and  proposed the use of French francs. Consequently it was agreed that the ACGD Officer  would give Barclays the list of participants and th e bank itself would make the remaining  DSA payments.       15.     That memorandum also stated that:    6 (a)  The ACGD Officer had received US$5,000 and US$ 3,500 to cover  miscellaneous expenses. He also received US$22,000 in notes late 18 February 1999,  US$3,327 in notes and US$3,300 in travellers’ chequ es early on 19 February 1999 to  facilitate the payment of DSA;     (b) Payment of DSA was handled directly by Barclays ’ representative in the  presence of UNDP Liaison Officer Lucas and the ACGD Officer; and    (c) The bank tellers directly paid participants US$ 12,173. The ACGD Officer  stated, “The DSA payment included under the bank sl ip in the amount of US$10,120.00  and US$2,053.00 which was made on 19 February 1999 was handled at the bank  counter…”    16.        According to Barclays’ letter dated 27 June 2000 and Official 4’s memorandum  of March 3, 2000, the ACGD Officer received the sum s of US$22,000 and US$3,327 in  notes and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques for the p ayment of participants.  The bank paid  participants DSA in the sums of US$10,120 and US$2, 053.    17.       When interviewed the ACGD Officer told ID/OIO S that Official 2 had asked him  to pay miscellaneous expenses and DSA to the partic ipants of the Seychelles conference.   He said that ECA had written to UNDP Mauritius, who asked UNDP HQ for authority to  transfer funds to Barclays in Seychelles. The ACGD Officer then cashed the funds and  disbursed DSA to participants.     18.       He said that on 17 February 1999 he paid the first group of participants at the  hotel in the presence of the UNDP Officer.  He indi cated his payment to participants on  the list by placing asterisks against their names. On 18 February 1999 Barclays paid the  other participants using the attendance list suppli ed by the ACGD Officer.  Upon receipt  of identification from the payees, the bank tellers  had the participant sign his/her name on  the attendance list and paid the DSA. The ACGD Offi cer said that he was present when  the bank tellers paid the remaining participants an d that after the payments were made,  the attendance list was returned to him.     19.       The ACGD Officer confirmed that it was his re sponsibility to ensure that  participants received their DSA and signed their na mes against the attendance list upon  receipt of their DSA. Lack of a signature against a  name meant that that person did not  attend the conference.    20.       The ACGD Officer provided ID/OIOS with the at tendance list during the course  of his interview. Of the three queried payments, th ere was an asterisk only against  Participant 1’s name on the attendance list.      21.       He said that for persons who did not attend t he conference, instructions had to be  given for their PT.8’s to be cancelled. There were no cancellations before the conference  but they were four to five after the conference.   7   22.       ID/OIOS Investigators observed that the PT.8’ s for Participant 1, Participant 2  and Participant 3 were all cancelled after the conf erence by Official 2.       23.       The ACGD Officer explained the cancellation o f PT.8’s after the conference by  saying that some governments substituted participan ts a few days before the conference.  As a result of such late cancellations and/or subst itutions it is only after the conference  that instructions are given to cancel and amend the  relevant PT.8 forms accordingly.    24.       ID/OIOS showed the ACGD Officer three cancell ed PT.8’s.    (a) The ACGD Officer examined the cancelled PT.8 fo r Participant 1, and  said that she had not attended the conference. But when shown a signature and asterisk  against her name on the attendance list, indicating  payment of US$1,000 in DSA, he said  that he could not confirm whether he had given inst ructions to cancel the PT.8 and that it  was possible that it had been done by the Director.      (b) The ACGD Officer was shown a cancelled PT.8 for  Participant 2. Upon  seeing a signature against this name (but no asteri sk) as having received US$1,068 in  DSA, he told ID/OIOS that the secretaries could hav e gotten the wrong information or  the Director may have given the wrong instructions for the travel to be cancelled.      (c) The ACGD Officer was shown a cancelled PT.8 for  Participant 3.  Upon  seeing a signature against this name (but no asteri sk) as having received US$943 in DSA,  he said that it was a mistake similar to that of th e case of Participant 2.      (d) In all of these cases the PT.8’s were cancelled  by Official 2 on 19 March  1999, after the conference.      25.       The ACGD Officer explained these discrepancie s by suggesting that a bank  employee might have tampered with the DSA list and forged signatures of participants  who did not attend and then pocketed their DSA. He said that he dealt with the manager;  a teller and a go-between person and that any one o f them could have falsely signed the  DSA list. However, he had previously acknowledged t hat he had witnessed the payments  being made by the Bank staff and he had not raised any questions or concerns then or at  any time before being questioned by ID/OIOS Investi gators on this point.  However, he  claimed to be surprised by the discrepancies pointe d out by ID/OIOS.  He then  acknowledged that he had received memoranda from Of ficial 4 asking him to account,  amongst other things, for the moneys that he had be en given for DSA, but he thought that  the matter had been settled despite the unaccounted  discrepancies.    26.     ID/OIOS, in a telephone interview with Particip ant 3, asked if she had attended the  Seychelles conference and she stated that she had n ot. She added that she had not been  invited to attend and had not received any DSA for this conference.    8 27.     In a second interview with the ACGD Officer by phone, he was told that  Participant 3 confirmed that she had not attended t he conference. He again said that he  had not paid all the participants, Barclays had pai d some, and that the situation during  payment was chaotic. He said it was difficult to re member whom he paid and there could  have been errors.    28.       ID/OIOS attempted to interview Participant 1 and Participant 2 but was unable to  locate them at the contact numbers provided. ID/OIO S also attempted to locate the  UNDP Officer, but the UNDP Liaison office had been c losed in 1999 and attempts to  locate her through other UNDP contacts proved futile .  The ACGD Officer was unable to  provide ID/OIOS with the names of bank personnel wh o were involved with the DSA  payments.    29.       ID/OIOS interviewed a staff member, who said that each person attending the  conference was required to register and that a list  of these attendees were then compiled  and included in a Report that was prepared on the C onference.  She told ID/OIOS that  this list is usually accurate but could at times co ntain errors, for instance if the list was  prepared before the conference rather than from the  Register, it might not be accurate.  ID/OIOS reviewed the list included in the Report an d noted that the names of Participant  1, Participant 2 and Participant 3 were not include d.     30.      When ID/OIOS first asked the ACGD Officer on A pril 28, 2003 how much money  he had received for the payment of DSA, he said tha t he had only received US$5,000 for  miscellaneous expenses. However when ID Investigato rs showed the ACGD Officer  Barclays’ documents with his signature, indicating that he had received US$22,000, he  admitted that it was his signature and that he had in fact received US$22,000 from the  bank for payment of DSA. Although the bank records show that the ACGD Officer had  also received US$3,327 in cash for DSA payment and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques - a  total of US$28,627, the ACGD Officer said that he c ould not remember having received  these sums of money. He also confirmed that he had signed for the receipt of the funds  Barclays paid out.  ID reminded the ACGD Officer of the contents of his  memorandum of  18 February 2000 where he acknowledged receipt of a dditional sums and he admitted the  contents of that memorandum .    31.       The ACGD Officer said that in June 1999 he pr epared a report and submitted a  certificate of expenses to Officer 8 of the Disburs ement Unit.  The report was reviewed  by Official 2, who signed the memorandum forwarding  the report.      32.       Official 2 was not present at the time of ID/ OIOS’s mission to ECA.  Consequently, ID/OIOS forwarded certain questions i n relation to the Seychelles  conference and she furnished answers.    33.       ID/OIOS asked Official 2 if she was satisfied  that the ACGD Officer gave a  proper explanation for the apparent discrepancies a nd whether there was a final report.  She responded by saying that the ACGD Officer had p rovided a comprehensive  explanation of the apparent discrepancies to Offici al 4.  She placed the blame for  9 improper payment of DSA on Barclays since the bank staff made the payments, but does  not take into account the ACGD Officer’s acknowledg ement of witnessing these same  payments or his responsibility for the safeguarding  of the funds entrusted to him.  She  also said that following the ACGD Officer’s corresp ondence of 24 March 2000, a  meeting was called by Official 5 to discuss the iss ue with the ACGD Officer and Official  3. Subsequently, instruction was given by the Direc tor of PPFD to close the account with  the submitted supporting documents.     34.       ID/OIOS reviewed the ACGD Officer’s memorandu m dated 24 March 2000. In  that memorandum the ACGD Officer confirmed that DSA  was paid to the bearers of the  five PT.8 numbers to which Official 4 referred. He agreed that payment of DSA to non- attendees was a serious matter, but, as had Officia l 2, placed the blame on Barclays,  claiming that the bank had paid the DSAs.      35.       ID/OIOS observed that Official 2 and the ACGD  Officer stated in their joint  memorandum of 18 February 2000 that the ACGD Office r had paid some participants  DSA and Barclays paid the rest.  However, both Offi cial 2 and the ACGD Officer when  interviewed, and the ACGD Officer in his memorandum  of 24 March 2000, claimed  Barclays had paid all the DSA.      36.       In memorandum dated 13 April 2000 from Offici al 3 to Official 4, Official 3  recommended that an independent investigation be co nducted into the matter because  despite requests for more documentation and explana tions, the ACGD Officer did not  properly account for the expenses of the meeting.         VI. FINDINGS  OF  FACT    Issue 1:  Did the ACGD Officer inappropriately use his office for financial gain?     37.     The ACGD Officer confirmed at his interview s that he was entrusted with payment  of miscellaneous expenses and DSA to participants a t the Seychelles conference.  In his  interoffice memorandum of 18 February 2004, [see pa ragraphs 14 and 15], he admitted  that he had collected US$28,627 for these payments.   Although the allegation was that  US$12,000 had been misappropriated, ID/OIOS found t hat only US$3,011 was  unaccounted for [see paragraph 11].  The attendance  list used for payment of DSA had no  asterisk against the name of Participant 3 and Part icipant 2 (indicating that the Barclays  had “paid” them), but there was an asterisk against  the name of Participant 1 - a system  devised by the ACGD Officer which was used by him t o indicate that he had made a  specific payment, in this instance indicating that the ACGD Officer had “paid” her [see  paragraph 18].       38.      The ACGD Officer’s theory that the Barclay  Bank staff were responsible does not  withstand scrutiny. First, he acknowledges that he witnessed the payments made by the  Bank; second, while the Bank may have performed thi s service for him, he retained  responsibility for the accounting for the funds giv en to him; third, nowhere else had The  10  ACGD Officer claimed that the bank staff took the f unds until he was questioned by  Investigators including at the time the disbursemen ts were made and later when  questioned about the discrepancies by ECA managers.     Issue 2:  Did The ACGD Officer appropriately safegu ard the cash advances for the  conference and  did he properly account for these advances as requ ired by Financial Rule  104.9?     39.      Official 3 asked the ACGD Officer for an a ccounting of US$49,000 he had  received for payment of DSA and other expenses at t he conference in his inter-office  memorandum of 19 January 2000 [see paragraph 10].  In his inter-office memorandum of  18 February 2004, the ACGD Officer admitted collect ing US$38,627 for payment of  DSA to participants at the conference [see paragrap h 15.a].  However, in his interview of  April 28, 2003, he first claimed that he had only r eceived US$5,000 (for miscellaneous  expenses), but then admitted he had received US$22, 000 [see paragraph 30].  The ACGD  Officer blamed the chaotic atmosphere during paymen t of DSA for any discrepancies.   However, it is apparent that he did not safeguard a nd protect the cash advances for the  conference as required by Financial Rule 104.9, nor  did he provide a proper accounting  of these funds.    Issue 3:  Did the ACGD Officer keep proper records of payment of DSA and other  conference expenses as required by Financial Rule 1 04.10 (b) and (c)?     40.      By the ACGD Officer’s admission in paragra ph 27, payments of DSA at the  conference were chaotic and there could have been e rrors for which he bears full  responsibility as the person assigned to make the d isbursement of these United Nations  funds.  In addition, receipt of funds was indicated  only by signature next to a name on the  attendance list.  This is not proper recording of d isbursements as required by Financial  Rule 104.10 (b) and (c).       VII. CONCLUSIONS    41. The signatures for three people on the attendan ce list, who did not attend the  conference, were forged and the disbursements to th em unaccounted for, resulting in a  loss of US$3,011 to ECA. There are only two possibi lities:  first, that the ACGD Officer  forged the signatures and retained the money and se cond, that a bank employee forged  the signatures and kept the money despite the ACGD Officer’s presence during the  disbursement process and he failed to notice or to raise the issue. Either way, the ACGD  Officer is responsible for the loss of funds.       42. It is of additional concern that despite questi ons raised regarding the loss of the  funds and the failure to safeguard the money on the  part of the ACGD Officer, ECA  managers did not take measures to hold him accounta ble or to determine whether the  manner of handling the funds in this case might war rant further scrutiny for the purpose  of avoiding similar problems in future.   11      VIII.

The Investigations Division, Office of Internal Ove rsight Services (ID/OIOS) received a complaint that an Economic Commission of Africa (ECA) staff member misappropriated the sum of US$12,000 that was inten ded as Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) for five participants attending a c onference in Seychelles. This complaint, received in 2001 some two years after th e alleged commission of the misappropriation, did not provide the name of the c onference, when it was held, or the name of the subject. In the course of its prelimina ry investigation, soon after receipt of this matter, ID/OIOS learned that the complainant n o longer worked at ECA and was inaccessible through other contact numbers given to ID/OIOS. In spite of these difficulties however, ID/OIOS subsequently investig ated this case during one of its ECA missions when it found time to do so for the purpos e of ascertaining whether the theft could be corroborated and if so, identifying the pe rpetrator and any system weaknesses. II. APPLICABLE LAWS 2. Staff Regulation 1.2 (g) Staff members shall not use their office or knowled ge gained from their official functions for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for th e private gain of any third party, including family, friends and those they favour. No r shall staff members use their office for personal reasons to prejudice the positions of those they do not favour. 3. Financial Rule 104.9 (ST/SGB/2003/7) Officials to whom cash advances are issued shall be held personally accountable and financially liable for the proper management and sa fekeeping of cash so advanced and must be in a position to account for these advances at all times. They shall submit monthly accounts unless otherwise directed by the U nder-Secretary-General for Management. 4. Financial Rule 104.10 (ST/SGB/2003/7) (b) Disbursements shall be recorded in the accounts as at the date on which they are made, that is, when the cheque is issued, trans fer is effected or cash is paid out. (c) Except where a paid cheque is returned by the b ank or a debit advice is received from the bank, a payee’s written receipt s hall be obtained for all disbursements. 4 III. METHODOLOGY 5. ID/OIOS interviewed the ACGD Officer, ECA’s Officia l 1, and other staff members. Investigators also obtained and analyzed d ocuments including personnel records, bank records and the list of participants for the Seychelles conference indicating who was paid DSA. IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 6. ID/OIOS determined that the conference in question was “An Eastern and Southern Africa Sub Regional Meeting” and was held from 15 to 18 February, 1999 at the Berjaja Mahe Beach Resort Hotel in Victoria, Se ychelles. It was organized by the African Centre for Women (ACW), now the African Cen tre for Gender Development (ACGD). 7. This conference attracted over 100 participants, 46 of whom were sponsored by ECA. The rest were sponsored by other international organizations. 8. When ECA finances a conference, a list of participa nts is prepared and then a travel request (a “PT.8”) is prepared for each part icipant. The PT.8 is certified by the Director of the Division and sent to the Finance Di vision, which verifies that the correct account number is quoted and that there is sufficie nt money to honor the request. It is then recorded in the Integrated Management Informat ion System (IMIS), which demonstrates approval of the request. A letter to UNDP referencing the PT.8 number and account number is prepared and the Finance Division approves that letter before it is sent to UNDP for payment to be made to the attendee. 9. Typically when ECA sponsors a conference, it arrang es with the UNDP office in the country in which the conference is held to pay DSA to participants. However, there was no UNDP office in the Seychelles. Consequently the airfares and 50 per cent of DSA were paid to participants by UNDP offices in each p articipant’s country and the ACGD Officer was entrusted with the payment of the remai ning 50 per cent of DSA to participants while they were at the conference. Wh en UNDP makes its payments, it sends an inter-office voucher (IOV) to ECA indicati ng the amount of money they have spent and ECA reimburses UNDP. If the DSA was not pa id and ticket not issued by UNDP, then an IOV credit is sent to the Finance Div ision. Cancellation of a PT.8 indicates that that person did not attend the confe rence, and the UNDP office in question would then issue an IOV credit to ECA. V. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS 10. In an inter-office memorandum dated 19 January 2000 , Official 3 asked the ACGD Officer to settle relevant claims and to provi de supporting documentation for the 5 US$49,000 the ACGD Officer had received for payment of DSA and other miscellaneous expenses at the conference. In a subsequent inter- office memorandum dated 17 February 2000, Official 4 specifically questioned the paymen t of DSA to five people who had apparently not attended the 1999 Seychelles confere nce. 11. ID/OIOS Investigators observed that of the five PT. 8 reference numbers referred to by Official 4 in his memorandum of 17 February 2 000, one was repeated and another PT.8 had in fact not been cancelled, leaving three rather than five apparently inappropriately disbursed DSA payments in the amoun t of US$3,011. The attendance list showed that the PT.8’s in question were for Partici pant 1, Participant 2 and Participant 3. 12. ID/OIOS obtained the following documentation for th e money disbursed to the ACGD Officer for the payment of DSA. (a) Official 5 authorized Official 6 to pay the ACGD Of ficer the sum of US$40,000: US$35,000 for the remaining half of the DSA to be paid to the conference participants and US$5,000 for miscellaneous expense s. (b) Official 5 authorized the payment of a further sum of US$9,000 to the ACGD Officer for DSA to be paid to the conference p articipants. 13. Receipt of payment of US$49,000 was confirmed as fo llows: (a) Advice notes from Barclays Bank PLC Independenc e Square (“Barclays”) confirm that US$49,300 was paid to the ACGD Officer . Barclays overpaid the ACGD Officer US$300 and debited this amount from UNDP’s a ccount. (b) A letter dated 8 March 2000 from Official 7 of UNDP office in Mauritius, confirmed that the ACGD Officer received US$49,000: US$44,000 of which was to pay 50 per cent DSA to participants. 14. In an inter-office memorandum dated 18 Februar y 2000, both Official 2 and the ACGD Officer responded to Official 4’s 17 February 2000 inquiry of payment of DSA to persons whose PT.8’s were cancelled and had not att ended the conference. Official 2 stated that the funds transferred to Seychelles by ECA were managed by herself, the ACGD Officer and the UNDP Officer in Port Louis, Sey chelles. She further stated that the amount transferred to pay the remaining 50 per cent of DSA was only made available after the end of the conference, which created chao s in paying participants before their departures. In addition, Barclays did not have suff icient smaller US denominations and proposed the use of French francs. Consequently it was agreed that the ACGD Officer would give Barclays the list of participants and th e bank itself would make the remaining DSA payments. 15. That memorandum also stated that: 6 (a) The ACGD Officer had received US$5,000 and US$ 3,500 to cover miscellaneous expenses. He also received US$22,000 in notes late 18 February 1999, US$3,327 in notes and US$3,300 in travellers’ chequ es early on 19 February 1999 to facilitate the payment of DSA; (b) Payment of DSA was handled directly by Barclays ’ representative in the presence of UNDP Liaison Officer Lucas and the ACGD Officer; and (c) The bank tellers directly paid participants US$ 12,173. The ACGD Officer stated, “The DSA payment included under the bank sl ip in the amount of US$10,120.00 and US$2,053.00 which was made on 19 February 1999 was handled at the bank counter…” 16. According to Barclays’ letter dated 27 June 2000 and Official 4’s memorandum of March 3, 2000, the ACGD Officer received the sum s of US$22,000 and US$3,327 in notes and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques for the p ayment of participants. The bank paid participants DSA in the sums of US$10,120 and US$2, 053. 17. When interviewed the ACGD Officer told ID/OIO S that Official 2 had asked him to pay miscellaneous expenses and DSA to the partic ipants of the Seychelles conference. He said that ECA had written to UNDP Mauritius, who asked UNDP HQ for authority to transfer funds to Barclays in Seychelles. The ACGD Officer then cashed the funds and disbursed DSA to participants. 18. He said that on 17 February 1999 he paid the first group of participants at the hotel in the presence of the UNDP Officer. He indi cated his payment to participants on the list by placing asterisks against their names. On 18 February 1999 Barclays paid the other participants using the attendance list suppli ed by the ACGD Officer. Upon receipt of identification from the payees, the bank tellers had the participant sign his/her name on the attendance list and paid the DSA. The ACGD Offi cer said that he was present when the bank tellers paid the remaining participants an d that after the payments were made, the attendance list was returned to him. 19. The ACGD Officer confirmed that it was his re sponsibility to ensure that participants received their DSA and signed their na mes against the attendance list upon receipt of their DSA. Lack of a signature against a name meant that that person did not attend the conference. 20. The ACGD Officer provided ID/OIOS with the at tendance list during the course of his interview. Of the three queried payments, th ere was an asterisk only against Participant 1’s name on the attendance list. 21. He said that for persons who did not attend t he conference, instructions had to be given for their PT.8’s to be cancelled. There were no cancellations before the conference but they were four to five after the conference. 7 22. ID/OIOS Investigators observed that the PT.8’ s for Participant 1, Participant 2 and Participant 3 were all cancelled after the conf erence by Official 2. 23. The ACGD Officer explained the cancellation o f PT.8’s after the conference by saying that some governments substituted participan ts a few days before the conference. As a result of such late cancellations and/or subst itutions it is only after the conference that instructions are given to cancel and amend the relevant PT.8 forms accordingly. 24. ID/OIOS showed the ACGD Officer three cancell ed PT.8’s. (a) The ACGD Officer examined the cancelled PT.8 fo r Participant 1, and said that she had not attended the conference. But when shown a signature and asterisk against her name on the attendance list, indicating payment of US$1,000 in DSA, he said that he could not confirm whether he had given inst ructions to cancel the PT.8 and that it was possible that it had been done by the Director. (b) The ACGD Officer was shown a cancelled PT.8 for Participant 2. Upon seeing a signature against this name (but no asteri sk) as having received US$1,068 in DSA, he told ID/OIOS that the secretaries could hav e gotten the wrong information or the Director may have given the wrong instructions for the travel to be cancelled. (c) The ACGD Officer was shown a cancelled PT.8 for Participant 3. Upon seeing a signature against this name (but no asteri sk) as having received US$943 in DSA, he said that it was a mistake similar to that of th e case of Participant 2. (d) In all of these cases the PT.8’s were cancelled by Official 2 on 19 March 1999, after the conference. 25. The ACGD Officer explained these discrepancie s by suggesting that a bank employee might have tampered with the DSA list and forged signatures of participants who did not attend and then pocketed their DSA. He said that he dealt with the manager; a teller and a go-between person and that any one o f them could have falsely signed the DSA list. However, he had previously acknowledged t hat he had witnessed the payments being made by the Bank staff and he had not raised any questions or concerns then or at any time before being questioned by ID/OIOS Investi gators on this point. However, he claimed to be surprised by the discrepancies pointe d out by ID/OIOS. He then acknowledged that he had received memoranda from Of ficial 4 asking him to account, amongst other things, for the moneys that he had be en given for DSA, but he thought that the matter had been settled despite the unaccounted discrepancies. 26. ID/OIOS, in a telephone interview with Particip ant 3, asked if she had attended the Seychelles conference and she stated that she had n ot. She added that she had not been invited to attend and had not received any DSA for this conference. 8 27. In a second interview with the ACGD Officer by phone, he was told that Participant 3 confirmed that she had not attended t he conference. He again said that he had not paid all the participants, Barclays had pai d some, and that the situation during payment was chaotic. He said it was difficult to re member whom he paid and there could have been errors. 28. ID/OIOS attempted to interview Participant 1 and Participant 2 but was unable to locate them at the contact numbers provided. ID/OIO S also attempted to locate the UNDP Officer, but the UNDP Liaison office had been c losed in 1999 and attempts to locate her through other UNDP contacts proved futile . The ACGD Officer was unable to provide ID/OIOS with the names of bank personnel wh o were involved with the DSA payments. 29. ID/OIOS interviewed a staff member, who said that each person attending the conference was required to register and that a list of these attendees were then compiled and included in a Report that was prepared on the C onference. She told ID/OIOS that this list is usually accurate but could at times co ntain errors, for instance if the list was prepared before the conference rather than from the Register, it might not be accurate. ID/OIOS reviewed the list included in the Report an d noted that the names of Participant 1, Participant 2 and Participant 3 were not include d. 30. When ID/OIOS first asked the ACGD Officer on A pril 28, 2003 how much money he had received for the payment of DSA, he said tha t he had only received US$5,000 for miscellaneous expenses. However when ID Investigato rs showed the ACGD Officer Barclays’ documents with his signature, indicating that he had received US$22,000, he admitted that it was his signature and that he had in fact received US$22,000 from the bank for payment of DSA. Although the bank records show that the ACGD Officer had also received US$3,327 in cash for DSA payment and US$3,300 in travellers’ cheques - a total of US$28,627, the ACGD Officer said that he c ould not remember having received these sums of money. He also confirmed that he had signed for the receipt of the funds Barclays paid out. ID reminded the ACGD Officer of the contents of his memorandum of 18 February 2000 where he acknowledged receipt of a dditional sums and he admitted the contents of that memorandum . 31. The ACGD Officer said that in June 1999 he pr epared a report and submitted a certificate of expenses to Officer 8 of the Disburs ement Unit. The report was reviewed by Official 2, who signed the memorandum forwarding the report. 32. Official 2 was not present at the time of ID/ OIOS’s mission to ECA. Consequently, ID/OIOS forwarded certain questions i n relation to the Seychelles conference and she furnished answers. 33. ID/OIOS asked Official 2 if she was satisfied that the ACGD Officer gave a proper explanation for the apparent discrepancies a nd whether there was a final report. She responded by saying that the ACGD Officer had p rovided a comprehensive explanation of the apparent discrepancies to Offici al 4. She placed the blame for 9 improper payment of DSA on Barclays since the bank staff made the payments, but does not take into account the ACGD Officer’s acknowledg ement of witnessing these same payments or his responsibility for the safeguarding of the funds entrusted to him. She also said that following the ACGD Officer’s corresp ondence of 24 March 2000, a meeting was called by Official 5 to discuss the iss ue with the ACGD Officer and Official 3. Subsequently, instruction was given by the Direc tor of PPFD to close the account with the submitted supporting documents. 34. ID/OIOS reviewed the ACGD Officer’s memorandu m dated 24 March 2000. In that memorandum the ACGD Officer confirmed that DSA was paid to the bearers of the five PT.8 numbers to which Official 4 referred. He agreed that payment of DSA to non- attendees was a serious matter, but, as had Officia l 2, placed the blame on Barclays, claiming that the bank had paid the DSAs. 35. ID/OIOS observed that Official 2 and the ACGD Officer stated in their joint memorandum of 18 February 2000 that the ACGD Office r had paid some participants DSA and Barclays paid the rest. However, both Offi cial 2 and the ACGD Officer when interviewed, and the ACGD Officer in his memorandum of 24 March 2000, claimed Barclays had paid all the DSA. 36. In memorandum dated 13 April 2000 from Offici al 3 to Official 4, Official 3 recommended that an independent investigation be co nducted into the matter because despite requests for more documentation and explana tions, the ACGD Officer did not properly account for the expenses of the meeting. VI. FINDINGS OF FACT Issue 1: Did the ACGD Officer inappropriately use his office for financial gain? 37. The ACGD Officer confirmed at his interview s that he was entrusted with payment of miscellaneous expenses and DSA to participants a t the Seychelles conference. In his interoffice memorandum of 18 February 2004, [see pa ragraphs 14 and 15], he admitted that he had collected US$28,627 for these payments. Although the allegation was that US$12,000 had been misappropriated, ID/OIOS found t hat only US$3,011 was unaccounted for [see paragraph 11]. The attendance list used for payment of DSA had no asterisk against the name of Participant 3 and Part icipant 2 (indicating that the Barclays had “paid” them), but there was an asterisk against the name of Participant 1 - a system devised by the ACGD Officer which was used by him t o indicate that he had made a specific payment, in this instance indicating that the ACGD Officer had “paid” her [see paragraph 18]. 38. The ACGD Officer’s theory that the Barclay Bank staff were responsible does not withstand scrutiny. First, he acknowledges that he witnessed the payments made by the Bank; second, while the Bank may have performed thi s service for him, he retained responsibility for the accounting for the funds giv en to him; third, nowhere else had The 10 ACGD Officer claimed that the bank staff took the f unds until he was questioned by Investigators including at the time the disbursemen ts were made and later when questioned about the discrepancies by ECA managers. Issue 2: Did The ACGD Officer appropriately safegu ard the cash advances for the conference and did he properly account for these advances as requ ired by Financial Rule 104.9? 39. Official 3 asked the ACGD Officer for an a ccounting of US$49,000 he had received for payment of DSA and other expenses at t he conference in his inter-office memorandum of 19 January 2000 [see paragraph 10]. In his inter-office memorandum of 18 February 2004, the ACGD Officer admitted collect ing US$38,627 for payment of DSA to participants at the conference [see paragrap h 15.a]. However, in his interview of April 28, 2003, he first claimed that he had only r eceived US$5,000 (for miscellaneous expenses), but then admitted he had received US$22, 000 [see paragraph 30]. The ACGD Officer blamed the chaotic atmosphere during paymen t of DSA for any discrepancies. However, it is apparent that he did not safeguard a nd protect the cash advances for the conference as required by Financial Rule 104.9, nor did he provide a proper accounting of these funds. Issue 3: Did the ACGD Officer keep proper records of payment of DSA and other conference expenses as required by Financial Rule 1 04.10 (b) and (c)? 40. By the ACGD Officer’s admission in paragra ph 27, payments of DSA at the conference were chaotic and there could have been e rrors for which he bears full responsibility as the person assigned to make the d isbursement of these United Nations funds. In addition, receipt of funds was indicated only by signature next to a name on the attendance list. This is not proper recording of d isbursements as required by Financial Rule 104.10 (b) and (c). VII. CONCLUSIONS 41. The signatures for three people on the attendan ce list, who did not attend the conference, were forged and the disbursements to th em unaccounted for, resulting in a loss of US$3,011 to ECA. There are only two possibi lities: first, that the ACGD Officer forged the signatures and retained the money and se cond, that a bank employee forged the signatures and kept the money despite the ACGD Officer’s presence during the disbursement process and he failed to notice or to raise the issue. Either way, the ACGD Officer is responsible for the loss of funds. 42. It is of additional concern that despite questi ons raised regarding the loss of the funds and the failure to safeguard the money on the part of the ACGD Officer, ECA managers did not take measures to hold him accounta ble or to determine whether the manner of handling the funds in this case might war rant further scrutiny for the purpose of avoiding similar problems in future. 11 VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1 It is recommended that appropriate action be taken against the ACGD Officer, including for being in breach of Financial Rule 104.9 and 104 .10 (b) and (c). (ID Rec. No. IV01/202/01) Recommendation 2 It is recommended that ECA management review its ca sh disbursement practices for additional gaps and examine this case for lessons l earned to avoid similar problems in future.

(Case 0283/04)      I. INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants which led to an investigation concernin g alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are three specific allegations in this rep ort of investigation:  • Employees overcharged commercial flights using Pri stina Airport for handling and  landing fees and other services.  • Employees failed to account for the money paid to them in handling and landing  fees and other services.  • Employees requested and /or received corrupt payme nts in return for allocating  landing slots to airlines at the most convenient ti mes.      II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest   standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct . “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her  obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and the  Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuan ces, or to observe the standards of  conduct expected of an international civil servant,  may amount to unsatisfactory  conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of  disciplinary measures for misconduct.”          2      III. METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.    4. This report details the findings resulting from these enquiries.      IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    5. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999,  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    6. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport  and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs.  DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the  armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer I,  Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and late r by the Consultant from the  Consulting Firm.    7. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under him  were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official.    8. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    9. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.    3    V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     10. This case concerns allegations of corruption by  staff at Pristina Airport arising  from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in  the period January – December 2001. The case also d eals with allegations of  corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on pa ssenger aircraft using the  Airport during the same period and alleged requests  for corrupt payments for the  allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most  convenient times.    11. Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in  2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact th at fees appear to have been  collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater  risk of fraudulent activity existed.    12. Where possible, similar dates and the type of a ircraft were selected to allow for a  comparative analysis of landing charges and passeng er charges.    13. An average price was then calculated for each t ype of aircraft by selecting a  sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give  an estimate of the total income from landing fees.    14. The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication  as to the respective costs for basic airport servic es, based on the weight of the  aircraft.     Handling Fees and De-icing costs    15. The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949  (equivalent to €7,341,163. This compares with a fig ure of €7,376,182 in the profit  and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Account ants.     16. This result suggests that in the absence of fur ther information, the aircraft  charges agreed with the figures produced in the off icial accounts of the Airport.  However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot  be verified. The possibility therefore remains that  airlines were routinely  overcharged.    17. It was noted that there are small variations in  the prices charged to different  airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, ce rtain airlines appeared to have  measurably lower costs. These were:  • Airline 1 – Average DM 2190  • Airline 2 – Average DM 2888.    18. The receipts books do not indicate whether Airl ine 1 carried passengers and if so,  how many.     19. It was notable that where aircraft requested de -icing facilities, this appears to  have added considerably to the landing fees costs.     20. A schedule was created detailing costs associat ed with de-icing. With the  possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this do es not appear to indicate any     4      obvious anomalies, although it again did not take i nto account the possibility that  airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-ic ing.      Landing Fees    21. Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM p er passenger. A spreadsheet  was created detailing the total number of persons t ravelling in the period 1  February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not  paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January  2001.    22. The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a  total of 375,472 passengers  during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not  pay the required passenger  tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and conv erted to Euro per paying  passenger, this gives a total of €4,799,395 as agai nst a stated income figure in  the accounts of €4,919,190 for the whole year. This  gap is diminished if a number  of passengers were to be added for the month of Jan uary 2001.    23. However, there remains a possibility that the p assengers were not being charged  airport tax when they should have been, or that the  sums detailed in the accounts  do not equate with sums actually paid.    24. In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for  handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the IT F sent a request to IATA to  provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airl ine 5 and Airline 6 concerning any  instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The  request also sought information concerning any inst ances of corruption arising  from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Ai rport.    25. Regrettably, to date, no substantive response h as been received from the airlines  or IATA.      VI. CONCLUSIONS     26. Whilst the figures for handling and landing fee s broadly agree with the figures  produced in the accounts of the Airport, it is not possible to ascertain whether the  source of information forming the basis of the acco unts is reliable.    27. In the absence of cooperation from the Airlines  and IATA, despite repeated  requests by the ITF, it is not possible to progress  the case further.      VII. RECOMMENDATIONS    28. It is therefore recommended that based on the r esults of this investigation,  UNMIK should prepare an official request to the abo ve-mentioned airlines in an  effort to obtain their support and any information relevant to this matter.

However, a  KTA Internal Audit Department staff member confirmed that no breaches of KTA  rules, UNMIK procurement rules, or the above-mentioned agreement could be identified in the purchase of the new policy through the ICAA. The ITF hrther  concludes that UNMIK procurement rules were not applicable to the ICAA as the  agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA (for the government of Iceland) is  prevailing and does not identify such a requirement.  6.

The Investigation Task Force (ITF) has been investi gating an allegation regarding  administrative irregularities regarding the insuran ce coverage for Pristina Airport  by a London-based Company, who then purchased the c over from Insurance  Company 1 between 2001 and 2003.   2.  Based on extensive documentation obtained from UNMI K Pillar II, the Kosovo  Trust Agency (KTA) and Public Enterprise Airport Pr istina (PEAP), the ITF  determined that the responsible Manager did not und ertake efforts in 2002 or  2003 to invite international tenders for the Airpor t’s insurance coverage.  According to UNMIK regulations 1999/2 – Finance Adm inistration Instruction on  Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Funds – and in view of the cost  of the premiums of more than $125,000 USD, such a t ender should have been  undertaken. The Manager did not prepare an internat ional tender for at least the  period 2 October 2003 to 1 October 2004, instead, h e concluded a contract in  favour of Insurance Company 1 effecting insurance c overage pertaining to  Pristina International Airport for a further year. It should be considered as to  whether this conduct demonstrates probable cause wi th regard to the waste or  misappropriation of public funds. Such an issue sho uld be determined by a review  of the matter by the Department of Justice.  3.  The ITF investigation also adduced evidence of doub le insurance coverage at  Pristina International Airport.

That t ask was undertaken at the  request of UNMIK.   4.  The Manager had direct contact with the above-menti oned Insurance Ccompany 2  for the preparation of the new coverage. Despite th e fact that the Airport  insurance coverage by London-based Company/Insuranc e Company 1 was valid  until 2 October 2004, the insurance coverage arrang ed by UNMIK and the  Insurance Company 2 commenced on 1 April 2004 and i ncluded the same  insurance substance, but with even higher sums insu red and several small  amendments.   5.  The contract with Insurance Company 1 covered the p eriod 2 October 2003 to 1  October 2004. According to the Insurance Company 1 Contract Policy dated 9  July 2002, paragraph 4 of the General Conditions, t he “…Policy may be cancelled  at any time at the written request of the Insured …  provided 30 days notice …”.  The Manager would appear to have ignored that fact.  The airport therefore had  two insurance packages for the period 1 April to 1 October 2004.

38.pdf,"UNITED NATIONS   United Nations Interim  Administration Mission   in Kosovo    UNMIK NATIONS UNIES  Mission d’Administration  Intérimaire des Nations Unies  au Kosovo     INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE    Investigation into Allegations of Bribery and Favou ritism in Procurement of Uniforms  by Pristina Airport  (ITF Case No. 0462/04)    I. Background and Allegations    1. A Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) Internal Audit Unit (IAU) Internal Memorandum dated 4  October 2004, which described the audit of the proc urement of staff uniforms by Pristina  Airport, raised concerns as to the reasoning for th e cancellation of a competitive tender  for summer and winter uniforms (Pristina Airport Re ference No. PEAP/CG/UAS/19/05/04)  and the subsequent issue of a single source contrac t for summer uniforms for new staff  (Pristina Airport Reference No. SHKTA/CG/16-04).    2. In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter o f complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor  1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single  source contract to supply summer uniforms. The auth or of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager,  alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in t he matter of the bribery of  Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Fi nance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of  Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender proces s, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s  letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for  allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by:  re placing a member of the Bid Evaluation  Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a mem ber of the Finance Department, the  Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favou ring Vendor 2 in the tender process.    3. During the course of the investigation, Procurem ent Officer 1 told the ITF that, following  the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to  him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat.    4. The ITF commenced an inquiry into the allegation s regarding the procurement process  and now provides a summary of the case and its find ings and recommendations.      II. Applicable Law     5. The law applicable to each of the allegations is  detailed below.    Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor  2    Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 343 “ Accepting Bribes”; Article 344 “Giving  Bribes”    Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.3.2 –“Avoidance of  Conflicts of Interest and Corruption”    Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee    Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair  Competition”; Section 23.9 “Examination and Evaluat ion of Tenders”    Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid  Evaluation Committee     2Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair  Competition”; Section 23.9 “Examination and Evaluat ion of Tenders”    Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process    Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public  Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair  Competition”    Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1    Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 161 “ Threat”      III. Investigation Details     6. Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive te nder for the supply of uniforms. In  addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitt ed bids following which Procurement  Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Commit tee on 10-06-04. Present, in  addition to the committee that comprised members of  the various airport work groups,  were representatives of the three bidding companies  including Vendor 1 Manager.    7. Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the  offerings of the competitors, which comprised a ran ge of uniforms and accessories for the  various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-0 4, the committee, though not satisfied  with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in  favour of that company, the median  bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that  Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasi bility of no-cost design changes to  one of the uniforms for women employees. The commit tee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the  request of Pristina Airport Official. During the me eting, Pristina Airport Official announced  the cancellation of the tender. Pristina Airport Of ficial later awarded a single-source  procurement contract for summer uniforms for newly hired staff, in the amount of  €106,059, to Vendor 1, which had supplied uniforms to the airport under two previous  contracts.    Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor  2    8. When asked by the ITF to substantiate his/her al legation that Procurement Officer 1 and  the Finance Officer had accepted bribes from Vendor  2, Vendor 1 Manager said that  he/she had heard the rumours in Pristina coffee bar s but that he/she could not remember  from whom he/she had heard these rumours. He/she sa id that the witnesses to whom  he/she had referred in his letter of complaint were  actually the same persons from whom  he/she heard the rumours. Vendor 1 Manager was unab le to suggest which  representative of Vendor 2 had paid the bribes.    9. Vendor 2 Employee who attended the meeting of th e Bid Opening Committee; Vendor 2  Manager; and Vendor 2 Director all told ITF that th ey had not paid bribes to Procurement  Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer.    10. Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer b oth denied accepting bribes or any other  consideration from any person in this matter.    Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee    11. Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that  the original nominee to the committee,  Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day  that the committee first convened  and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee memb er 2, who then attended the  second session for continuity purposes. Committee m ember 1 and Committee member 2  confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for t he replacement.     3Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid  Evaluation Committee    12. The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that  the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluat ion Committee. However, Procurement  Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said t hat the other had nominated the Finance  Officer to the committee. KTA legal staff advised t he ITF that the wisdom of allowing a  representative of the Finance Department to partici pate in bid evaluations is questionable  because, generally, officers whose function involve s payment should not evaluate  contractors to whom payment will become due. Accord ing to KTA legal staff, however,  such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance  Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 D ecember 1999) – Public Procurement  Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes on ly an “approving officer” from the  Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contrac t from serving as a tender evaluator.  The Finance Officer was not an “approving officer” in this procurement process and,  therefore, was not prevented from serving as an eva luator.    Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process    13. In addition to Procurement Officer 1 and the Fi nance Officer, Bid Evaluation Committee  members Committee member 3, Committee member 4, Com mittee member 5,  Committee member 6, Committee member 2, and Committ ee member 7 told the ITF that  the conduct of the committee was completely fair an d proper. (Committee member 4 told  the ITF that he/she attended the first session of t he Bid Evaluation Committee but that  he/she missed the second session because of the ill ness of his son.) The general  consensus of the committee was that Vendor 2’s samp les were better overall in terms of  quality and design but the committee was not comple tely satisfied with Vendor 2’s goods.  However, Pristina Airport Official told the ITF tha t the committee was divided during the  second session, with one group preferring Vendor 2’ s goods and the other preferring  those of Vendor 1. Pristina Airport Official said t hat Procurement Officer 1 (who, as  committee chair, did not have the right to vote) an d the Finance Officer argued in favour  of Vendor 2. None of the committee members supporte d Pristina Airport Official’s  assertions in this regard.    14. The ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to re view a copy of the Bid Evaluation Committee  report prepared by Procurement Officer 1, the last page of which listed the attendees at  the session of the Bid Opening Committee (Procureme nt Officer 1 and the Finance  Officer were the only members of the Bid Opening Co mmittee who also served on the Bid  Evaluation Committee). Upon looking at the attendee  list of the Bid Opening Committee,  Pristina Airport Official named the committee membe rs who, he/she said, had Vendor 1’s  and Vendor 2’s samples respectively. He/she correct ly identified Procurement Officer 1  and the Finance Officer but the other four persons whom he/she named were members of  the Bid Opening Committee, not the Bid Evaluation C ommittee. Pristina Airport Official’s  mistaken identification of these persons as Bid Eva luation Committee members indicates  that his memory of the events of the second committ ee meeting might be unclear.    15. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she believed that had he/she not cancelled the  competitive tender, the Bid Evaluation Committee wo uld have awarded the contract to  Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/sh e believed that Procurement Officer 1  had been “primed” to award the contract to Vendor 2  because Procurement Officer 1 had  expressed a preference for and argued in support of  Vendor 2’s” inferior product and  because a source (whose identity Pristina Airport O fficial was unable to recall) had told  him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by  a person in either the Ministry of Finance or the M inistry of Transportation who was  associated with Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official  said that he/she cancelled the  competitive tender for these reasons. He/she said t hat he/she did not voice his suspicions  during the committee meeting, adding that he/she di d not subsequently report his  suspicions because “priming” is common and if he/sh e reported every instance he/she  would not have time to do his job. He/she said that  proving that Procurement Officer 1  had “pushed” one competitor would have been difficu lt.    16. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that a forme r Kosovo Minister is his godfather. He/she  said that he/she has never received a ride to the a irport from the Former Kosovo Minister   4or in his car. He/she said that he/she has no idea whether the Former Kosovo Minister is  in any way associated with Vendor 2. He/she said th at neither the Former Kosovo  Minister nor any other person pressured him/her to show favouritism to Vendor 2.    17. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she had not seen Vendor 1 Manager’s letter of  complaint and had never heard of Vendor 1 Manager’s  allegation regarding the bribery of  Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer. Howe ver, Pristina Airport Official’s  administrative assistant said that he/she had been present when Vendor 1 Manager  voiced his suspicion to Pristina Airport Official t hat an individual from the airport had  accepted bribes. Pristina Airport Official’ adminis trative assistant said that he/she could  not recall to whom Vendor 1 Manager referred. In ad dition, he/she told the ITF that  Vendor 1 Manager had given him/her his letter of co mplaint. Pristina Airport Official’s  administrative assistant said that he/she does not recall whether he/she handed the letter  to Pristina Airport Official or left it for his att ention and he/she does not recall Pristina  Airport Official mentioning the letter.    18. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that, fo llowing the cancellation of the competitive  tender, his only alternative to obtain uniforms for  newly hired staff was to award a contract  to Vendor 1, who had supplied the airport for the p ast two years. He/she said that had  he/she let a new tender for summer uniforms, the un iforms would not have been ready  until the end of August (2004).    19. ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to read a  copy of a memo dated 30-06-04 to him/her  from Procurement Officer 1 that described the event s of the tender process and  summarized the reasons for its cancellation. Pristi na Airport Official told the ITF that,  although he/she had signed the memo, he/she had not  “really read” it previously. The  articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed  below. Pristina Airport Official and  Procurement Officer 1 said that they had contribute d to the list of reasons but disagreed  over which of the reasons had been provided by whom , however, they both said that  Pristina Airport Official had provided the term “un satisfactory quality”.    i) unsatisfactory quality  ii) unsatisfactory design  iii) evaluation committee not satisfied with the un iforms  iv) no manufacturing details were given  v) documents not completed    20. Procurement Officer 2 told the ITF that he/she transmitted several documents regarding  the single-source procurement of summer uniforms to  KTA. Included in the document  package was a Procurement Memo dated 07-07-04 signe d by Pristina Airport Official and,  according to Procurement Officer 2, prepared by Pri stina Airport Official. (Pristina Airport  Official told the ITF that he/she believes that he/ she wrote the justification.) The  justification segment of the memo stated that unifo rms would be obtained by single- source procurement from the current supplier (Vendo r 1) for reasons of good quality and  durability.    21. The ITF pointed out to Pristina Airport Officia l that he/she had referred to the same  uniforms as being of “unsatisfactory quality” and “ good quality” in the respective  documents. He/she then admitted “flowering up” his memo and providing embellishment  to ensure that KTA would approve the procurement. H e/she said that the term  “unsatisfactory quality” in the memo dated 30-06-04  was poorly chosen and that the  quality of Vendor 1’s uniforms actually met the air port’s requirements. However, he/she  said that the design of the uniforms design was “ba sic and poor.”    Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1    22. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, on a d ay (he/she could not specify the date)  following the second meeting of the Bid Evaluation Committee at which the decision was  taken to cancel the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Ma nager entered Procurement Officer  1’s office and, in the presence of Procurement Offi cer 2 and a Pristina Airport Civil  Engineer made utterances that Procurement Officer 1  interpreted as a threat. According  to Procurement Officer 1, Vendor 1 Manager said tha t he/she would meet Procurement  Officer 1 outside; that, because he/she had cancell ed the tender, Procurement Officer 1   5would find out who Vendor 1 Manager was; and that P rocurement Officer 1 would see  what he/she had done by canceling the tender.    23. Procurement Officer 2 assistant confirmed that he/she had been present during the  incident but he/she had paid only partial attention  to what transpired. He/She said that  Vendor 1 Manager might have mentioned that Procurem ent Officer 1 would have to deal  with KTA Internal Audit and the Investigation Task Force. The Civil Engineer also  confirmed his presence and said that he/she could r ecall Vendor 1 Manager saying  something to the effect of “You have to see who I a m.” The Civil Engineer said that  he/she interpreted the words to mean that Procureme nt Officer 1 should be afraid of  Vendor 1 Manager.    24. Vendor 1 Manager confirmed that an incident had  occurred between him/her and  Procurement Officer 1. Vendor 1 Manager said that h e/she told Procurement Officer 1  that he/she was the main reason for the cancellatio n of the tender and that he/she told  Procurement Officer 1 “You’ll see what you have don e. You’ll see that I’ll go to the highest  levels and if necessary, I’ll see you in court.” Ve ndor 1 Manager said that he/she did not  ask Procurement Officer 1 to go outside with him/he r, that he/she did not threaten  Procurement Officer 1 and did not imply that he/she  would commit physical aggression.      IV. Findings of Fact    Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor  2    25. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1  and/or the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Ven dor 2 in this matter. Moreover, the  ITF did not find evidence that any person received a bribe or other compensation or a  promise of a bribe or other compensation in relatio n to either the competitive tender or the  single-source procurement. Therefore, the allegatio n of bribery is considered to be  unsubstantiated.    Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee    26. The rationale for replacing the member of the B id Evaluation Committee is reasonable.  Furthermore, Vendor 1 Manager did not intimate that  the replacement was made for any  questionable purpose. Therefore, the allegation is considered to be correct but the  substantive act is not considered to have been base d on ulterior motives.    Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately placed  the Finance Officer on the Bid  Evaluation Committee    27. The ITF established that the Finance Officer pa rticipated on the committee but did not  determine whether he/she was nominated by Procureme nt Officer 1 or Pristina Airport  Official. Regardless, the ITF did not identify any indication that The Finance Officer’s  behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofess ional or improper. In the absence  of specific regulations precluding the participatio n of finance personnel in such processes,  this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated .    Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process    28. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1 had  favoured Vendor 2 during the tender process. Simila rly, Pristina Airport Official’s opinion  that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to sel ect Vendor 2 is unsubstantiated. The  credibility of Pristina Airport Official’s portraya l of Procurement Officer 1 as a strong  proponent of Vendor 2 in a divided committee was co ntradicted by the committee  members themselves and undermined by Pristina Airpo rt Official’s misidentification of  most of the members. Procurement Officer 1’s manage ment of the proceedings appears  to have been fair and objective based on the assert ions of the members of the Bid  Evaluation Committee. Therefore, this allegation is  considered to be unsubstantiated.    Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1   6  29. The ITF was unable to substantiate that Vendor 1 Manager’s utterances constituted a  threat against Procurement Officer 1.      V. Recommendations    30.  The ITF offers the following recommendations:    Recommendation No. 1 : It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV inform Pro curement Officer 1  and the Finance Officer, as well as the KTA Interna l Audit Unit, that the ITF did not find any  wrongdoing on the part of Procurement Officer 1 or the Finance Officer. (IV04/462/01)    Recommendation No. 2 : It is recommended that UNMIK provide this report to both the  Department of Justice and the Financial Investigati on Unit for information purposes, so as to  assist current investigations related to the allege d payment of “kickbacks” in exchange for  employment at Pristina Airport. (IV04/462/02)","UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE Investigation into Allegations of Bribery and Favou ritism in Procurement of Uniforms by Pristina Airport (ITF Case No. 0462/04) I. Background and Allegations 1. A Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) Internal Audit Unit (IAU) Internal Memorandum dated 4 October 2004, which described the audit of the proc urement of staff uniforms by Pristina Airport, raised concerns as to the reasoning for th e cancellation of a competitive tender for summer and winter uniforms (Pristina Airport Re ference No. PEAP/CG/UAS/19/05/04) and the subsequent issue of a single source contrac t for summer uniforms for new staff (Pristina Airport Reference No. SHKTA/CG/16-04). 2. In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter o f complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor 1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single source contract to supply summer uniforms. The auth or of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager, alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in t he matter of the bribery of Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Fi nance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender proces s, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: re placing a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a mem ber of the Finance Department, the Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favou ring Vendor 2 in the tender process. 3. During the course of the investigation, Procurem ent Officer 1 told the ITF that, following the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat. 4. The ITF commenced an inquiry into the allegation s regarding the procurement process and now provides a summary of the case and its find ings and recommendations. II. Applicable Law 5. The law applicable to each of the allegations is detailed below. Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor 2 Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 343 “ Accepting Bribes”; Article 344 “Giving Bribes” Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.3.2 –“Avoidance of Conflicts of Interest and Corruption” Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair Competition”; Section 23.9 “Examination and Evaluat ion of Tenders” Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid Evaluation Committee 2Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair Competition”; Section 23.9 “Examination and Evaluat ion of Tenders” Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revi sed 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds – Section 4.1 “Full and Fair Competition” Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1 Provisional Criminal Code of Kosovo – Article 161 “ Threat” III. Investigation Details 6. Procurement Officer 1 managed the competitive te nder for the supply of uniforms. In addition to Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3 submitt ed bids following which Procurement Officer 1 convened and chaired a Bid Opening Commit tee on 10-06-04. Present, in addition to the committee that comprised members of the various airport work groups, were representatives of the three bidding companies including Vendor 1 Manager. 7. Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the offerings of the competitors, which comprised a ran ge of uniforms and accessories for the various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-0 4, the committee, though not satisfied with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in favour of that company, the median bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasi bility of no-cost design changes to one of the uniforms for women employees. The commit tee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the request of Pristina Airport Official. During the me eting, Pristina Airport Official announced the cancellation of the tender. Pristina Airport Of ficial later awarded a single-source procurement contract for summer uniforms for newly hired staff, in the amount of €106,059, to Vendor 1, which had supplied uniforms to the airport under two previous contracts. Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor 2 8. When asked by the ITF to substantiate his/her al legation that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer had accepted bribes from Vendor 2, Vendor 1 Manager said that he/she had heard the rumours in Pristina coffee bar s but that he/she could not remember from whom he/she had heard these rumours. He/she sa id that the witnesses to whom he/she had referred in his letter of complaint were actually the same persons from whom he/she heard the rumours. Vendor 1 Manager was unab le to suggest which representative of Vendor 2 had paid the bribes. 9. Vendor 2 Employee who attended the meeting of th e Bid Opening Committee; Vendor 2 Manager; and Vendor 2 Director all told ITF that th ey had not paid bribes to Procurement Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer. 10. Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer b oth denied accepting bribes or any other consideration from any person in this matter. Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee 11. Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee, Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee memb er 2, who then attended the second session for continuity purposes. Committee m ember 1 and Committee member 2 confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for t he replacement. 3Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately includ ed the Finance Officer in the Bid Evaluation Committee 12. The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluat ion Committee. However, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said t hat the other had nominated the Finance Officer to the committee. KTA legal staff advised t he ITF that the wisdom of allowing a representative of the Finance Department to partici pate in bid evaluations is questionable because, generally, officers whose function involve s payment should not evaluate contractors to whom payment will become due. Accord ing to KTA legal staff, however, such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 D ecember 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes on ly an “approving officer” from the Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contrac t from serving as a tender evaluator. The Finance Officer was not an “approving officer” in this procurement process and, therefore, was not prevented from serving as an eva luator. Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process 13. In addition to Procurement Officer 1 and the Fi nance Officer, Bid Evaluation Committee members Committee member 3, Committee member 4, Com mittee member 5, Committee member 6, Committee member 2, and Committ ee member 7 told the ITF that the conduct of the committee was completely fair an d proper. (Committee member 4 told the ITF that he/she attended the first session of t he Bid Evaluation Committee but that he/she missed the second session because of the ill ness of his son.) The general consensus of the committee was that Vendor 2’s samp les were better overall in terms of quality and design but the committee was not comple tely satisfied with Vendor 2’s goods. However, Pristina Airport Official told the ITF tha t the committee was divided during the second session, with one group preferring Vendor 2’ s goods and the other preferring those of Vendor 1. Pristina Airport Official said t hat Procurement Officer 1 (who, as committee chair, did not have the right to vote) an d the Finance Officer argued in favour of Vendor 2. None of the committee members supporte d Pristina Airport Official’s assertions in this regard. 14. The ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to re view a copy of the Bid Evaluation Committee report prepared by Procurement Officer 1, the last page of which listed the attendees at the session of the Bid Opening Committee (Procureme nt Officer 1 and the Finance Officer were the only members of the Bid Opening Co mmittee who also served on the Bid Evaluation Committee). Upon looking at the attendee list of the Bid Opening Committee, Pristina Airport Official named the committee membe rs who, he/she said, had Vendor 1’s and Vendor 2’s samples respectively. He/she correct ly identified Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer but the other four persons whom he/she named were members of the Bid Opening Committee, not the Bid Evaluation C ommittee. Pristina Airport Official’s mistaken identification of these persons as Bid Eva luation Committee members indicates that his memory of the events of the second committ ee meeting might be unclear. 15. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she believed that had he/she not cancelled the competitive tender, the Bid Evaluation Committee wo uld have awarded the contract to Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/sh e believed that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to award the contract to Vendor 2 because Procurement Officer 1 had expressed a preference for and argued in support of Vendor 2’s” inferior product and because a source (whose identity Pristina Airport O fficial was unable to recall) had told him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had been driven to the airport on several occasions by a person in either the Ministry of Finance or the M inistry of Transportation who was associated with Vendor 2. Pristina Airport Official said that he/she cancelled the competitive tender for these reasons. He/she said t hat he/she did not voice his suspicions during the committee meeting, adding that he/she di d not subsequently report his suspicions because “priming” is common and if he/sh e reported every instance he/she would not have time to do his job. He/she said that proving that Procurement Officer 1 had “pushed” one competitor would have been difficu lt. 16. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that a forme r Kosovo Minister is his godfather. He/she said that he/she has never received a ride to the a irport from the Former Kosovo Minister 4or in his car. He/she said that he/she has no idea whether the Former Kosovo Minister is in any way associated with Vendor 2. He/she said th at neither the Former Kosovo Minister nor any other person pressured him/her to show favouritism to Vendor 2. 17. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/ she had not seen Vendor 1 Manager’s letter of complaint and had never heard of Vendor 1 Manager’s allegation regarding the bribery of Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer. Howe ver, Pristina Airport Official’s administrative assistant said that he/she had been present when Vendor 1 Manager voiced his suspicion to Pristina Airport Official t hat an individual from the airport had accepted bribes. Pristina Airport Official’ adminis trative assistant said that he/she could not recall to whom Vendor 1 Manager referred. In ad dition, he/she told the ITF that Vendor 1 Manager had given him/her his letter of co mplaint. Pristina Airport Official’s administrative assistant said that he/she does not recall whether he/she handed the letter to Pristina Airport Official or left it for his att ention and he/she does not recall Pristina Airport Official mentioning the letter. 18. Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that, fo llowing the cancellation of the competitive tender, his only alternative to obtain uniforms for newly hired staff was to award a contract to Vendor 1, who had supplied the airport for the p ast two years. He/she said that had he/she let a new tender for summer uniforms, the un iforms would not have been ready until the end of August (2004). 19. ITF allowed Pristina Airport Official to read a copy of a memo dated 30-06-04 to him/her from Procurement Officer 1 that described the event s of the tender process and summarized the reasons for its cancellation. Pristi na Airport Official told the ITF that, although he/she had signed the memo, he/she had not “really read” it previously. The articulated reasons for the cancellation are listed below. Pristina Airport Official and Procurement Officer 1 said that they had contribute d to the list of reasons but disagreed over which of the reasons had been provided by whom , however, they both said that Pristina Airport Official had provided the term “un satisfactory quality”. i) unsatisfactory quality ii) unsatisfactory design iii) evaluation committee not satisfied with the un iforms iv) no manufacturing details were given v) documents not completed 20. Procurement Officer 2 told the ITF that he/she transmitted several documents regarding the single-source procurement of summer uniforms to KTA. Included in the document package was a Procurement Memo dated 07-07-04 signe d by Pristina Airport Official and, according to Procurement Officer 2, prepared by Pri stina Airport Official. (Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that he/she believes that he/ she wrote the justification.) The justification segment of the memo stated that unifo rms would be obtained by single- source procurement from the current supplier (Vendo r 1) for reasons of good quality and durability. 21. The ITF pointed out to Pristina Airport Officia l that he/she had referred to the same uniforms as being of “unsatisfactory quality” and “ good quality” in the respective documents. He/she then admitted “flowering up” his memo and providing embellishment to ensure that KTA would approve the procurement. H e/she said that the term “unsatisfactory quality” in the memo dated 30-06-04 was poorly chosen and that the quality of Vendor 1’s uniforms actually met the air port’s requirements. However, he/she said that the design of the uniforms design was “ba sic and poor.” Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1 22. Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, on a d ay (he/she could not specify the date) following the second meeting of the Bid Evaluation Committee at which the decision was taken to cancel the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Ma nager entered Procurement Officer 1’s office and, in the presence of Procurement Offi cer 2 and a Pristina Airport Civil Engineer made utterances that Procurement Officer 1 interpreted as a threat. According to Procurement Officer 1, Vendor 1 Manager said tha t he/she would meet Procurement Officer 1 outside; that, because he/she had cancell ed the tender, Procurement Officer 1 5would find out who Vendor 1 Manager was; and that P rocurement Officer 1 would see what he/she had done by canceling the tender. 23. Procurement Officer 2 assistant confirmed that he/she had been present during the incident but he/she had paid only partial attention to what transpired. He/She said that Vendor 1 Manager might have mentioned that Procurem ent Officer 1 would have to deal with KTA Internal Audit and the Investigation Task Force. The Civil Engineer also confirmed his presence and said that he/she could r ecall Vendor 1 Manager saying something to the effect of “You have to see who I a m.” The Civil Engineer said that he/she interpreted the words to mean that Procureme nt Officer 1 should be afraid of Vendor 1 Manager. 24. Vendor 1 Manager confirmed that an incident had occurred between him/her and Procurement Officer 1. Vendor 1 Manager said that h e/she told Procurement Officer 1 that he/she was the main reason for the cancellatio n of the tender and that he/she told Procurement Officer 1 “You’ll see what you have don e. You’ll see that I’ll go to the highest levels and if necessary, I’ll see you in court.” Ve ndor 1 Manager said that he/she did not ask Procurement Officer 1 to go outside with him/he r, that he/she did not threaten Procurement Officer 1 and did not imply that he/she would commit physical aggression. IV. Findings of Fact Allegation 1 : that Procurement Officer 1 and the Finance Office r accepted bribes from Vendor 2 25. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1 and/or the Finance Officer accepted bribes from Ven dor 2 in this matter. Moreover, the ITF did not find evidence that any person received a bribe or other compensation or a promise of a bribe or other compensation in relatio n to either the competitive tender or the single-source procurement. Therefore, the allegatio n of bribery is considered to be unsubstantiated. Allegation 2 : that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of t he Bid Evaluation Committee 26. The rationale for replacing the member of the B id Evaluation Committee is reasonable. Furthermore, Vendor 1 Manager did not intimate that the replacement was made for any questionable purpose. Therefore, the allegation is considered to be correct but the substantive act is not considered to have been base d on ulterior motives. Allegation 3 : that Procurement Officer 1 inappropriately placed the Finance Officer on the Bid Evaluation Committee 27. The ITF established that the Finance Officer pa rticipated on the committee but did not determine whether he/she was nominated by Procureme nt Officer 1 or Pristina Airport Official. Regardless, the ITF did not identify any indication that The Finance Officer’s behaviour on the committee was in any way unprofess ional or improper. In the absence of specific regulations precluding the participatio n of finance personnel in such processes, this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated . Allegation 4 : that Procurement Officer 1 favoured Vendor 2 in t he tender process 28. The ITF did not find any evidence to support th e allegation that Procurement Officer 1 had favoured Vendor 2 during the tender process. Simila rly, Pristina Airport Official’s opinion that Procurement Officer 1 had been “primed” to sel ect Vendor 2 is unsubstantiated. The credibility of Pristina Airport Official’s portraya l of Procurement Officer 1 as a strong proponent of Vendor 2 in a divided committee was co ntradicted by the committee members themselves and undermined by Pristina Airpo rt Official’s misidentification of most of the members. Procurement Officer 1’s manage ment of the proceedings appears to have been fair and objective based on the assert ions of the members of the Bid Evaluation Committee. Therefore, this allegation is considered to be unsubstantiated. Allegation 5 : that Vendor 1 Manager threatened Procurement Offi cer 1 6 29. The ITF was unable to substantiate that Vendor 1 Manager’s utterances constituted a threat against Procurement Officer 1. V. Recommendations 30. The ITF offers the following recommendations: Recommendation No. 1 : It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV inform Pro curement Officer 1 and the Finance Officer, as well as the KTA Interna l Audit Unit, that the ITF did not find any wrongdoing on the part of Procurement Officer 1 or the Finance Officer. (IV04/462/01) Recommendation No. 2 : It is recommended that UNMIK provide this report to both the Department of Justice and the Financial Investigati on Unit for information purposes, so as to assist current investigations related to the allege d payment of “kickbacks” in exchange for employment at Pristina Airport.

(Case 0280/04 )      I. INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants which led to an investigation concernin g alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are two specific allegations in this repor t of investigation:   • no proper description of the cabins for the cleani ng machines was included by  companies submitting bids in the first tender;  • tender specifications for both tenders the cleanin g machines were taken from the  brochure of one of the companies submitting a tende r, thereby giving it an unfair  advantage in the tender process.      II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary-General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest   standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds  provides that:  Article 4 1  – “Competition among and participation in the proc urement process  shall be maximised.”  Article 4.1.1  – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders  shall be treated  fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each  Tender shall be judged on its merits.”  Article 4.3.3 . – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or e mployee of such  consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of  2  the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering  for a contract, including  but not limited to preparations of specifications o r any other Tender Documents,     no such consultant nor any principal officer or emp loyee of such consultant, no  “related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender  for or sponsor or participate in  the Tendering for such contract.”  Article 15 1 – “ Technical specifications and descriptions of the Go ods, Works, or  Services to be procured shall be carefully prepared  to foster fair and open  competition among all suppliers.”  Article 15.4 – “ There shall be no requirements or reference in the technical  specifications to a particular trademark, brand nam e, patent, design, type, origin,  producer or service provider unless (a) there is no  sufficiently precise or  intelligible way of describing the procurement requ irements and (b) qualifying  words, such as “or equivalent” are included in such  requirement or reference.”    Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct . “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her  obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and the  Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuan ces, or to observe the standards of  conduct expected of an international civil servant,  may amount to unsatisfactory  conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of  disciplinary measures for misconduct.”      I. METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.      II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport  and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs.  DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  3  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the  armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer 1,  Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later  by the Consultant from the  Consulting Firm.    6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under him  were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.    7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.      III. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     9. This part of the investigation relates to two te nders for a contract, for the supply  of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value  of the contract was  €180,816.00.    Allegation 1  (It is alleged that the first tender was irregularl y cancelled due to the fact that no  proper description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines was included by  companies submitting bids in the first tender)    10. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procure ment Officer, dated 18 April  2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evalua tion process to select a  company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Air port on 18 April 2003.  However, a notification letter from the PEAP Offici al and the KTA Divisional  Manager to the companies participating in the tende r exercise dated 6 June 2003  confirms that this tender was cancelled.    11. When asked about the reason for the cancellatio n, the Procurement Officer 1  stated to the ITF that the technical specifications  for the first tender were taken  from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offer ed those machines, as a result  of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was  of the most expensive type. (See below allegation 2 )    12. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Eval uation Committee, when asked  the same question, stated that the first tender was  cancelled due to the fact that  the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the  cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submit ted. However, he/she added  that from his/her knowledge at least two of the com panies had included a proper  description of the cabins in their bid documents.    4  13. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the I TF that the Airport requested  cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleanin g could be carried out in  different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in  their bids. He/she did not indicate that two bidder s included a proper description  in their bid documents.    14. In the light of the evidence provided, and deta iled below, the ITF does not find  that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due  to the fact that no proper  description of the cabins for the cleaning machines  was included by companies  submitting bids in the first tender.    Allegation 2     First tender    (It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were  taken from the brochure of one of the companies sub mitting a tender, thereby giving  it an unfair advantage in the tender process)    15. The person responsible for drawing up the speci fications for the both tenders was  the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed  in interview that he/she had  been asked to draw up the specifications by the Mem ber of the Evaluation  Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of  the Evaluation Committee  provided him with signed photocopies from the broch ure of Vendor 1 in order to  assist him in drawing up the specifications. The En gineer at the Pristina Airport  added that he/she used them as a basis for the tech nical specifications. The ITF  located a draft of an undated handwritten note from  the Engineer at the Pristina  Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confir ms that he/she used the  photocopies from the brochure to assist him in draw ing up the technical  specifications for the cleaning machines. The Membe r of the Evaluation  Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed t he signed pages to the  Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the p reparation of the technical  specifications for the cleaning machines.     16. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Me mber of the Evaluation Committee  were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of  Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, an d in particular Articles 15.1 and  15.4.  The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicat ed that he/she worked on the  general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the  Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be  ignorant of Article 15  altogether.     Second tender    17. A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indi cates that a second tender  exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one.     18. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the s econd tender indicated that  although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender , Procurement Officer 2 did  the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluatio n Committee. This is  confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official  5  dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an  ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to  Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluati on committee in his/her  interview.      19. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation  committee chose Vendor 2.  However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for  signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport man agement, although he/she did  not state by whom, to put it on hold until the tech nical evaluation committee and  airport management had organised a meeting with the  Procurement Officer 1.    20. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to  concerns that the winning bid was the second most e xpensive and doubts that  the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company.    21. An examination of the technical evaluation repo rt and Vendor 2’s bid  documentation suggests that the specification produ ced by Vendor 2 was very  similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was  provided with the technical specifications in advan ce. In addition, Vendor 1, the  company from whose brochure the specifications were  taken, did not submit a  bid.     22. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the se cond largest producer of industrial  cleaning machines in one United Nations member stat e being founded in 1966. It  went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a mu lti-national company. An  Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2.  There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connec ted to the multi-national  company.    23. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interv iew with the ITF, also stated that the  evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whethe r it would be worthwhile  purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meet ing the specification criteria,  came at a high price.        IV. FINDINGS OF FACT    24. The first tender for cleaning machines was canc elled due to alleged deficiencies  in the description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines in the bids submitted  and the fact that a brochure from the Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the  technical specifications for the cleaning machines.  This gave rise to concerns that  the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company,  namely Vendor 1.    25. The second tender was not awarded due to concer ns that the technical  specifications produced from the brochure of Vendor  1 had given an unfair  advantage to one company; and doubts as to the high  purchase cost of the  cleaning machines which met the specification crite ria.    6    V. CONCLUSIONS    26. On the available information, the decision lead ing to the cancellation of the first  tender was correct, since concerns had been raised concerning both the  descriptions of the machines to be purchased and th e fact that a brochure from  Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technic al specifications for the  cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications  had given an unfair advantage to one company in bre ach of Article 15.1 of     UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.      27. The reasons for the second tender not proceedin g appear to be well founded if  concerns were expressed over the offer price and th e technical specification.  However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate  whether in this instance, the  use of technical specifications from a particular c ompany brochure was a  deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or  due to ignorance of the  regulations.      VI. RECOMMENDATION    28.  Based on the above information, the ITF recomm ends that UNMIK refer this  report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deeme d appropriate with regard to  ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders d o not utilise technical  specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the  course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01) .","UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo Investigation Task Force Investigation into allegations of irregularities in two tender processes for the supply of cleaning machines to Pristina Airport.

This part of the investigation relates to two te nders for a contract, for the supply of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was €180,816.00. Allegation 1 (It is alleged that the first tender was irregularl y cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender) 10.

Second tender 17. A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indi cates that a second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one. 18. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the s econd tender indicated that although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender , Procurement Officer 2 did the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluatio n Committee. This is confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official 5 dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluati on committee in his/her interview. 19. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2. However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport man agement, although he/she did not state by whom, to put it on hold until the tech nical evaluation committee and airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1. 20. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most e xpensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company. 21.

Based on the above information, the ITF recomm ends that UNMIK refer this report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deeme d appropriate with regard to ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders d o not utilise technical specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01) .",Kosovo; Pristina Airport; Pristina International Airport; the Pristina Airport,DOTI; Ko; Mem; Membe; Pristina; Repr; bre ach; concer ns,Airport; Airport Engineer 1; Civil Administration P; DOTI Official 1; Divisional; ICAO; ITF; KFOR; KTA; Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds; Pristina Air; Pristina Airport Procurement; Procure; Procurement; Public Procurement; Tender Documents; UN; UNITED NATIONS PROCEDURAL RULES Section 1; UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission; UNMIK; UNMIK Finance Administrative; United Nations; United Nations Sec; advan ce; the Air Traffic Control Services; the Airport Sector; the Chartered Accountants; the Consulting Firm; the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI; the Eval uation Committee; the Evaluatio n Committee; the Evaluation Committee; the Investigation Task Force; the Kosovo Force; the Kosovo Trust Agency; the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina; the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure; the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s,"1; 1 April 2004; 1 July 2002; 1.; 10; 10 June 1999; 10.2; 11; 110.1; 12; 12 December 1999; 14; 15; 15.4; 16; 18; 18 April 2003; 180,816.00; 19; 1966; 1999/2; 2; 2/1999; 20; 2001; 2002; 2003; 21; 22; 22 March 1989; 23; 24; 25 July 1999; 26; 27; 28; 28 February 2003; 3; 30 June 2003; 30 September 2001; 31 July 2000; 4; 4 13; 5; 6; 6 June 2003; 7; 8; 9; 9 July 2003; All Suppliers and Contractors; Article 15; Article 15 1; Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No.; Article 15.1; Article 15.4; Article 4 1; Article 4.1.1; Article 4.3.3; Articles 15.1; First; Pillar II; Pillar IV; Pristina International Airport; Procurement Officer 1; Second tender 17; UNMIK Regulation; Vendor 1; Vendor 1.; Vendor 2; Yugoslavian; at least two; first; one; second; the Charter of the United Nations; the Staff Regulations; the end of June 2002; two",DECEPTIVE PRACTICE,1,"{'doc_id': '39.pdf', 'timestamp': '2025-01-31T23:35:05.392914', 'length': 15051, 'dates': ['28 February 2003', '12 December 1999', '22 March 1989', '2001', '2003', '10 June 1999', '25 July 1999', 'the end of June 2002', 'the end of June 2002', '31 July 2000', '30 September 2001', '1 July 2002', '1 April 2004', '18 April 2003', '18 April 2003', '6 June 2003', 'Second tender 17', '30 June 2003', '9 July 2003', 'Vendor 1', '1966', '2002', 'Vendor 1', 'Vendor 1']}"

INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants, which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are seven specific allegations addressed i n this report of investigation:  • the highest bid received for the winter uniforms w as accepted;  • there was insufficient information on the bid eval uation sheets for the winter  and summer uniforms tender exercises;  • capital expenditure approval for the winter unifor ms contract was signed on 10  January 2003, after the contract had commenced;  • the value of the contract for summer uniforms was irregularly set at €3 below  the limit requiring a competitive tender;  • two companies were invited to tender for the summe r uniforms contract when  the evaluation report for the winter uniforms indic ated that Vendor 1 could not  offer the quality of uniforms required and Vendor 2  produced an incomplete  offer  • the invitations to quote for summer uniforms sent out to the companies  contained differing quantities of items.  • two further small quantities of uniforms in the su ms of €792 and €1,188  were  purchased without any supporting documents or justi fication.    II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest   standards of efficiency, competence and integrity.”     UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds  provides that:  Article 4 1  – “Competition among and participation in the proc urement process shall  be maximised.”  2 Article 4.1.1  – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders  shall be treated fairly,  equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favourit ism or prejudice and each Tender  shall be judged on its merits.”  Article 4.3.3 . – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or e mployee of such  consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of the  UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering for  a contract, including but not  limited to preparations of specifications or any ot her Tender Documents, no such  consultant nor any principal officer or employee of  such consultant, no “related  person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender for or s ponsor or participate in the  Tendering for such contract.”  Article 6.1.2 – The limit method of Competitive Shopping … shall no rmally be used  when the estimated contract value does not exceed D M 50,000.

METHODOLOGY    2. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  conducting interviews with all  relevant persons; obtaining documents from the Pris tina Airport administration  and from the Pillar IV administration, which were t hen analysed for relevance to  the inquiry at hand.    IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    3. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    4. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  3 including Official 1 and Official 2 Department of T ransport and Infrastructure  (DOTI) Official 1 was also involved in the matter. The DOTI was later known as  the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of In frastructure Affairs. DOTI  Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI  Official 2 was recruited by  DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 20 00 in charge of airport  operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and conti nued in this role until 30  September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers  seconded from one UN member state’s Army, specifica lly Airport Engineer 1,  Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and lat er by a Consultant from the  Consulting Company.    5. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed. Under him/her were the PEAP Official and Official 3.    6. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    7. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.    V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     8. This investigation relates to two tenders for co ntracts for the purchase of winter  and summer uniforms for staff members of Pristina A irport. The value of the  contract for the purchase of winter uniforms was €1 57,060 and the contract for  the purchase of summer uniforms was €24,997.    Allegations 1 & 2    (It is alleged that the highest bid received for th e winter uniforms was accepted,  when it was almost twice the cost of the two furthe r bids received);   and   (It is alleged there was insufficient information o n the bid evaluation sheets as to why  the offer from the third company was incomplete)     9. A bid evaluation report dated 6 December 2002 in dicates that 8 firms were issued  with documents and 4 bids were submitted. The bids were opened on 27  November 2002. The report indicates at page 3 that Vendor 3’s offer in the sum  of €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other t wo bids from Vendor 1  (€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850), which were reject ed.     10. The reason specified for rejection of the bid b y Vendor 1 on page four of the  evaluation was that the evaluation committee asked the company to produce a  specimen of each type of uniform and it failed to d o so. This is confirmed in a  letter to Vendor 1 dated 27 November 2002. A simila r letter was delivered to  Vendor 3.     11. The evaluation report also concluded that the c ompany Vendor 1 has one  manufacturer in Peja, which can’t offer the require d quality and had too long a  date for completion.    4 12. In the case of Vendor 2, the evaluation report states that the company provided  an incomplete offer.     13. When asked in what manner the offer was incompl ete in interview, the  Procurement Officer, a member of the Evaluation Com mittee, stated that Vendor  2 submitted an offer, which did not contain all the  required articles.     14. The Procurement Officer was asked why his/her e xplanation was not put in the  tender evaluation. He/she replied that it was due t o his/her lack of English. In  view of the fact that the evaluation committee all signed the evaluation report,  they would have been aware of the reason for Vendor  2’s rejection.    15. The ITF contacted Vendor 2 and requested it to provide a copy of the tender  documents in order verify whether or not its offer was incomplete. However, the  company did not deliver any documents, or provide a ny information other than  the name of the person who delivered the documents and samples for the tender  to Pristina Airport. The ITF was therefore unable t o verify the Procurement  Officer’s explanation.    16. The explanation in the evaluation report that V endor 1 produced uniforms which  were of lower quality, together with the explanatio n given by the Procurement  Officer in interview that Vendor 2 submitted an off er which did not contain all the  required articles, may account in part for the diff erence in price between the offer  from Vendor 3 and the lower offers from Vendor 2 an d Vendor 1. However, the  price difference is of concern.    17. A letter of notification and a signed contract dated 6 December 2002 confirm that  Vendor 3 was awarded the contract for the supply of  uniforms to administrative  and maintenance personnel for the winter season.     Allegation 3  (It is alleged that the capital expenditure approva l for the winter uniforms contract  was signed on 10 January 2003, after the contract a nd a letter of notification to the  company had already been signed on 6 December 2002)     18. A capital expenditure approval for the winter u niforms contract appears to have  been signed by the Divisional Manager on 10 January  2003, after a letter of  notification to the company and the contract had al ready been signed on 6  December 2002.    19. In view of the necessity to have expenditure au thorised prior to signature of a  contract, the PEAP Official and the Divisional Mana ger were asked in interview  why the contract appeared to be signed before the c apital expenditure had been  approved.    20. The PEAP Official indicated that although the c ontract was dated 6 December  2004, the actual date of signature for the contract  was the protocol stamp on the  contract, which was 14 January 2003.     21. The Divisional Manager stated that there was no  date indicating when the  contract was signed and added that the date on the contract would not  necessarily correspond with the date on which the c ontract has been signed.  5 He/she added that the evidence was not conclusive t hat the contract had been  signed before capital expenditure approval was obta ined.    22. The Divisional Manager added that he/she assume d the protocol stamp date of  14 January 2003 was the date that the contract was returned to the Airport.    23. A better indicator as to the date on which the contract was signed is contained in  a routing slip from the Procurement Officer to Offi cial 4 of Pillar IV, and the KTA  Official dated 13 January 2003. The routing slip st ates “your signatures are  required before we present the contract to the sele cted supplier.” This suggests  that the contract may not have been signed until 13  January 2003, (i.e. after  capital expenditure approval had been obtained.)     Allegation 4  (It is alleged that the value of the contract for s ummer uniforms was irregularly set at  €3 below the limit requiring a competitive tender)    24. On 3 April 2003 an invitation to quote for the supply of uniforms for the summer  season was sent out to 4 companies, of which 3 subm itted quotes / bids by the  deadline of 11 April 2003.     25. The offers received were evaluated and Vendor 3  awarded the contract. A  contract was signed by Vendor 3 on 12 April 2003 an d countersigned by the  Divisional Manager on 18 April 2003.     26. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply  of for summer uniforms (€24,997)  was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shop ping. This gives rise to  concerns that the offer was set at a level to avoid  the necessity for a competitive  tender.     27. Whilst there is no evidence that this was delib erately done, a second offer was  received from the company Vendor 2 in the sum of €3 9,541.00. In view of the fact  that the evaluation report indicates that contract to be approximately €25,000 it is  questionable as to whether a competitive tender sho uld have been held rather  than competitive shopping.    Allegation 5  (It is alleged that the companies Vendor 1 and Vend or 2 were invited to tender for  the summer uniforms contract when the evaluation re port for the winter uniforms  indicated that Vendor 1 could not offer the quality  of uniforms required and Vendor 2  produced an incomplete offer, thereby affording an advantage to the supplier of the  winter uniforms, Vendor 3)    28. The evaluation report and tender documents indi cate that two companies Vendor  2 and Vendor 1 were requested to provide competitiv e bids, in spite of the fact  that some five months earlier, Vendor 2’s previous offer for the winter uniforms  had been rejected by the evaluation committee as in complete, as it had not  included all the items requested; whilst Vendor 1’s  previous offer for the winter  uniforms had been rejected on the basis that it had  one manufacturer in Peja  which could not offer the required quality.    29. The opinion of the winter uniforms evaluation c ommittee concerning Vendor 1  was repeated in the findings of the summer uniforms  evaluation committee, which  6 was indicated by the Procurement Officer to have re jected Vendor 1’s offer on the  grounds that its offer for the uniforms was not res ponsive from the cut and quality  point of view.    30. The grounds for the two rejections gave rise to  concerns that the inclusion of the  two companies in the tender for summer uniforms may  have afforded an  advantage to Vendor 3, the eventual winner. Having analysed the available  evidence and carried out research into the two comp anies, the selection of  Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the  region, although doubts about the Vendor 1’s suitab ility to participate in the  summer competitive shopping exercise remain.    31. The Procurement Officer, a member of the evalua tion committee, stated in the  course of his/her interview that the companies were  invited by one of the PEAP  secretaries Secretary 1 or Secretary 2.    32. The PEAP Official also indicated that the worke r who took delivery of the summer  uniforms was Secretary 2.    33. Due to Secretary 2’s possible connection with a nother more serious criminal  case, involving alleged payments of money in return  for jobs at Pristina Airport,  (ITF Case 0377/04) a decision was taken by the ITF not to interview Secretary 2  concerning the choice of companies invited to submi t bids in the competitive  shopping procedure, in order to avoid any possible prejudice to the more serious  case.     34. A decision was also taken not to interview Vend or 3 representative, concerning  this case due to the fact that he/she was one of th e principal suspects in the  same criminal case.    35. Whilst there are some doubts as to the inclusio n of Vendor 1, the selection of  Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the  region. In view of this, the ITF does not find that  the competitive shopping  procedure was organised in such a manner as to prov ide an unfair advantage to  the existing supplier Vendor 3.     Allegation 6  (It is alleged that the invitations to quote for su mmer uniforms sent out to the  companies contained differing quantities of items)    36. The two invitations to quote for summer uniform s submitted by the companies  Vendor 3 and Vendor 1 contain different quantities of items from that submitted  by the company Vendor 2. Whilst it is accepted that  the price of the offer received  from Vendor 2 was much higher than the other two, i t raised a question as to  whether different quantities of items may have been  sent to competing  companies.     37. When asked about the differences in the quantit ies of items, the Procurement  Officer stated that the quantities were changed and  revised documents sent out  to all the companies before the deadline to submit the offers had ended. He/she  added that the Airport, as the procuring entity had  the right to do so. In view of  this response, the company Vendor 2 was not intervi ewed.    7 Allegation 7   (It is alleged that two further small quantities of  uniforms in the sums of €792 and  €1,188 were purchased without any supporting docume nts or justification)    38. Two invoices dated 4 July 2003 and 5 August 200 3 indicate that two quantities of  99 and 66 T-Shirts respectively were ordered with a  value of €1188 and €792  respectively.     39. When asked about these extra purchases, the PEA P Official stated that he/she  assumed the Airport hired some students and tempora ry staff for three months  and that the T-Shirts were for them to wear. The PE AP Official subsequently  produced two written requests from the Security Off icial, for the two orders dated  1 July 2003 and 1 August 2003.    40. When asked why two orders were placed within on e month of one another, rather  than together, the PEAP Official stated that the ai rport had run out of T-shirts and  therefore purchased them from the same company in o rder to have the same  design of T-shirt.     41. This explanation is not a credible one, since i t suggests that the Airport did not  have any idea as to the numbers of temporary staff being taken on over a period  of only three months. If this was the case, it indi cates poor management.    42. An alternative could be that two orders were pl aced to avoid having to organise a  competitive bidding procedure, since the limit for single source procurements at  that time was €1250.     43. The Security Official was also interviewed by t he ITF in connection with the two  orders for t-shirts dated 1 July 2003 and 1 August 2003. He/she initially stated  that the t-shirts were purchased for 70 students hi red in the summer of 2003.  However, he/she later added having re-read the docu ments that they were also  purchased for approximately 30 workers as well.    44.  Whilst the requests do indicate the t-shirts t o have been purchased for technical  services workers and students, both appear to relat e to “physical workers”. In  view of the fact that the Security Official stated earlier in his/her interview that  each student would be allocated 3 shirts and one pa ir of trousers. The number of  t-shirts ordered -99 and 66- does not correspond wi th the number of employees.    45. In addition, the two requests specify that the shirts should be the same as the  previous shirts of the existing workers. This requi rement suggests that Vendor 3,  who had just won a tender for the provision of summ er uniforms to Pristina  Airport in April 2003, had already been chosen as t he supplier.    46. The Security Official stated that he/she had be en asked to write a request for  uniforms by the Divisional Manager following a conv ersation between them on  the need for uniforms for the student workers. When  asked why he/she had  addressed the two requests to the PEAP Official rat her than the Divisional  Manager, he/she replied that this was because the P EAP Official was his/her  superior. However, neither of the requests mentions  that the Security Official has  spoken to the Divisional Manager.    8 47. The Security Official also indicated in his/her  interview that he/she asked the  Divisional Manager whether a company could be found  to supply the t-shirts as it  would be longer and more expensive if a tender proc edure took place. When  questioned further about this response, he/she late r added   “It was not foreseen to have a tender procedure in connection with the shirts  for students and the part time workers.”    48. However, he/she could not recall who authorised  the purchase of the t-shirts  without a tender procedure. In summary, evidence fr om the two memoranda  requesting t-shirts and from the Security Official suggest that two orders were  placed within the space of one month with the compa ny Vendor 3 in order to  avoid having to organise a competitive bidding proc edure, since the limit for  single source procurements at that time was €1250. The documents also suggest  that the party who authorised the purchase was the PEAP Official.     VI. CONCLUSIONS     49. Whilst noting the comments in the capital expen diture approval that Vendor 3  was the only company that can provide the quality o f uniforms needed within the  time limit, it is of concern that Vendor 3’s offer for winter uniforms in the sum of  €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from Vendor 1  (€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850). However, this may  in part be due to the fact  that the Vendor 2 submitted an offer that did not c ontain all the required articles,  whilst Vendor 1 produced uniforms of lower quality.     50. The only original bid documents seen by the ITF  relating to the tender for the  supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenanc e personnel for the winter  season is the bid submitted by Vendor 3. Therefore,  the ITF is unable to verify  the findings of the evaluation committee resulting in the rejection of the bids  submitted by the two other companies.    51. Evidence as to whether or not capital expenditu re was or was not obtained prior  to signature of the contract is inconclusive, since  the date on the contract, (6  December 2002) is contradicted by the routing slip dated 13 January 2003, which  suggests that the letter of notification and contra ct may not have been signed  until after 10 January 2003. The benefit of the dou bt must therefore be given to  the Divisional Manager in this respect.     52. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply  of for summer uniforms (€24,997)  was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shop ping of €25,000. This raises  concerns as to whether a competitive tender should have been held rather than  competitive shopping procedure.    53. Whilst there are some doubts as to the quality of uniforms produced by Vendor 1,  the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been just ified in view of its size and  reputation in the region. The ITF does not therefor e find that the competitive  shopping procedure was organised in such a manner a s to provide an unfair  advantage to the existing supplier Vendor 3.    54. The evidence that companies submitting bids wer e irregularly requested to  provide different quantities of items is not proven  in the light of the response  given in interview by the Procurement Officer.    9 55. In spite of the explanation given by the PEAP O fficial, evidence from the Security  Official indicates that the two small orders for T- shirts were placed at a value of  €1188 and €792, in order to avoid having to organis e a competitive shopping  procedure, since the limit for single source procur ements at that time was €1250.  It is likely that this was a conscious decision and  constitutes a breach of Article  24 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999 /2 on Public Procurement  using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.    VII. RECOMMENDATIONS    56. It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take app ropriate action against PEAP  Official based on the findings of this report. (IV0 4/275/01)    57. It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV undertak e a review of the procedures for  signing and dating contracts to ensure clarity as t o the date on which a contract is  executed.

METHODOLOGY 2. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by conducting interviews with all relevant persons; obtaining documents from the Pris tina Airport administration and from the Pillar IV administration, which were t hen analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand. IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 3. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999. UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport. 4. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, 3 including Official 1 and Official 2 Department of T ransport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1 was also involved in the matter. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of In frastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 20 00 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and conti nued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from one UN member state’s Army, specifica lly Airport Engineer 1, Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and lat er by a Consultant from the Consulting Company. 5. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed. Under him/her were the PEAP Official and Official 3. 6. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations. 7. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined. V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS 8. This investigation relates to two tenders for co ntracts for the purchase of winter and summer uniforms for staff members of Pristina A irport. The value of the contract for the purchase of winter uniforms was €1 57,060 and the contract for the purchase of summer uniforms was €24,997. Allegations 1 & 2 (It is alleged that the highest bid received for th e winter uniforms was accepted, when it was almost twice the cost of the two furthe r bids received); and (It is alleged there was insufficient information o n the bid evaluation sheets as to why the offer from the third company was incomplete) 9. A bid evaluation report dated 6 December 2002 in dicates that 8 firms were issued with documents and 4 bids were submitted. The bids were opened on 27 November 2002. The report indicates at page 3 that Vendor 3’s offer in the sum of €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other t wo bids from Vendor 1 (€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850), which were reject ed. 10. The reason specified for rejection of the bid b y Vendor 1 on page four of the evaluation was that the evaluation committee asked the company to produce a specimen of each type of uniform and it failed to d o so. This is confirmed in a letter to Vendor 1 dated 27 November 2002. A simila r letter was delivered to Vendor 3. 11. The evaluation report also concluded that the c ompany Vendor 1 has one manufacturer in Peja, which can’t offer the require d quality and had too long a date for completion. 4 12. In the case of Vendor 2, the evaluation report states that the company provided an incomplete offer. 13. When asked in what manner the offer was incompl ete in interview, the Procurement Officer, a member of the Evaluation Com mittee, stated that Vendor 2 submitted an offer, which did not contain all the required articles. 14. The Procurement Officer was asked why his/her e xplanation was not put in the tender evaluation. He/she replied that it was due t o his/her lack of English. In view of the fact that the evaluation committee all signed the evaluation report, they would have been aware of the reason for Vendor 2’s rejection. 15. The ITF contacted Vendor 2 and requested it to provide a copy of the tender documents in order verify whether or not its offer was incomplete. However, the company did not deliver any documents, or provide a ny information other than the name of the person who delivered the documents and samples for the tender to Pristina Airport. The ITF was therefore unable t o verify the Procurement Officer’s explanation. 16. The explanation in the evaluation report that V endor 1 produced uniforms which were of lower quality, together with the explanatio n given by the Procurement Officer in interview that Vendor 2 submitted an off er which did not contain all the required articles, may account in part for the diff erence in price between the offer from Vendor 3 and the lower offers from Vendor 2 an d Vendor 1. However, the price difference is of concern. 17. A letter of notification and a signed contract dated 6 December 2002 confirm that Vendor 3 was awarded the contract for the supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenance personnel for the winter season. Allegation 3 (It is alleged that the capital expenditure approva l for the winter uniforms contract was signed on 10 January 2003, after the contract a nd a letter of notification to the company had already been signed on 6 December 2002) 18. A capital expenditure approval for the winter u niforms contract appears to have been signed by the Divisional Manager on 10 January 2003, after a letter of notification to the company and the contract had al ready been signed on 6 December 2002. 19. In view of the necessity to have expenditure au thorised prior to signature of a contract, the PEAP Official and the Divisional Mana ger were asked in interview why the contract appeared to be signed before the c apital expenditure had been approved. 20. The PEAP Official indicated that although the c ontract was dated 6 December 2004, the actual date of signature for the contract was the protocol stamp on the contract, which was 14 January 2003. 21. The Divisional Manager stated that there was no date indicating when the contract was signed and added that the date on the contract would not necessarily correspond with the date on which the c ontract has been signed. 5 He/she added that the evidence was not conclusive t hat the contract had been signed before capital expenditure approval was obta ined. 22. The Divisional Manager added that he/she assume d the protocol stamp date of 14 January 2003 was the date that the contract was returned to the Airport. 23. A better indicator as to the date on which the contract was signed is contained in a routing slip from the Procurement Officer to Offi cial 4 of Pillar IV, and the KTA Official dated 13 January 2003. The routing slip st ates “your signatures are required before we present the contract to the sele cted supplier.” This suggests that the contract may not have been signed until 13 January 2003, (i.e. after capital expenditure approval had been obtained.) Allegation 4 (It is alleged that the value of the contract for s ummer uniforms was irregularly set at €3 below the limit requiring a competitive tender) 24. On 3 April 2003 an invitation to quote for the supply of uniforms for the summer season was sent out to 4 companies, of which 3 subm itted quotes / bids by the deadline of 11 April 2003. 25. The offers received were evaluated and Vendor 3 awarded the contract. A contract was signed by Vendor 3 on 12 April 2003 an d countersigned by the Divisional Manager on 18 April 2003. 26. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms (€24,997) was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shop ping. This gives rise to concerns that the offer was set at a level to avoid the necessity for a competitive tender. 27. Whilst there is no evidence that this was delib erately done, a second offer was received from the company Vendor 2 in the sum of €3 9,541.00. In view of the fact that the evaluation report indicates that contract to be approximately €25,000 it is questionable as to whether a competitive tender sho uld have been held rather than competitive shopping. Allegation 5 (It is alleged that the companies Vendor 1 and Vend or 2 were invited to tender for the summer uniforms contract when the evaluation re port for the winter uniforms indicated that Vendor 1 could not offer the quality of uniforms required and Vendor 2 produced an incomplete offer, thereby affording an advantage to the supplier of the winter uniforms, Vendor 3) 28. The evaluation report and tender documents indi cate that two companies Vendor 2 and Vendor 1 were requested to provide competitiv e bids, in spite of the fact that some five months earlier, Vendor 2’s previous offer for the winter uniforms had been rejected by the evaluation committee as in complete, as it had not included all the items requested; whilst Vendor 1’s previous offer for the winter uniforms had been rejected on the basis that it had one manufacturer in Peja which could not offer the required quality. 29. The opinion of the winter uniforms evaluation c ommittee concerning Vendor 1 was repeated in the findings of the summer uniforms evaluation committee, which 6 was indicated by the Procurement Officer to have re jected Vendor 1’s offer on the grounds that its offer for the uniforms was not res ponsive from the cut and quality point of view. 30. The grounds for the two rejections gave rise to concerns that the inclusion of the two companies in the tender for summer uniforms may have afforded an advantage to Vendor 3, the eventual winner. Having analysed the available evidence and carried out research into the two comp anies, the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region, although doubts about the Vendor 1’s suitab ility to participate in the summer competitive shopping exercise remain. 31. The Procurement Officer, a member of the evalua tion committee, stated in the course of his/her interview that the companies were invited by one of the PEAP secretaries Secretary 1 or Secretary 2. 32. The PEAP Official also indicated that the worke r who took delivery of the summer uniforms was Secretary 2. 33. Due to Secretary 2’s possible connection with a nother more serious criminal case, involving alleged payments of money in return for jobs at Pristina Airport, (ITF Case 0377/04) a decision was taken by the ITF not to interview Secretary 2 concerning the choice of companies invited to submi t bids in the competitive shopping procedure, in order to avoid any possible prejudice to the more serious case. 34. A decision was also taken not to interview Vend or 3 representative, concerning this case due to the fact that he/she was one of th e principal suspects in the same criminal case. 35. Whilst there are some doubts as to the inclusio n of Vendor 1, the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region. In view of this, the ITF does not find that the competitive shopping procedure was organised in such a manner as to prov ide an unfair advantage to the existing supplier Vendor 3. Allegation 6 (It is alleged that the invitations to quote for su mmer uniforms sent out to the companies contained differing quantities of items) 36. The two invitations to quote for summer uniform s submitted by the companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 1 contain different quantities of items from that submitted by the company Vendor 2. Whilst it is accepted that the price of the offer received from Vendor 2 was much higher than the other two, i t raised a question as to whether different quantities of items may have been sent to competing companies. 37. When asked about the differences in the quantit ies of items, the Procurement Officer stated that the quantities were changed and revised documents sent out to all the companies before the deadline to submit the offers had ended. He/she added that the Airport, as the procuring entity had the right to do so. In view of this response, the company Vendor 2 was not intervi ewed. 7 Allegation 7 (It is alleged that two further small quantities of uniforms in the sums of €792 and €1,188 were purchased without any supporting docume nts or justification) 38. Two invoices dated 4 July 2003 and 5 August 200 3 indicate that two quantities of 99 and 66 T-Shirts respectively were ordered with a value of €1188 and €792 respectively. 39. When asked about these extra purchases, the PEA P Official stated that he/she assumed the Airport hired some students and tempora ry staff for three months and that the T-Shirts were for them to wear. The PE AP Official subsequently produced two written requests from the Security Off icial, for the two orders dated 1 July 2003 and 1 August 2003. 40. When asked why two orders were placed within on e month of one another, rather than together, the PEAP Official stated that the ai rport had run out of T-shirts and therefore purchased them from the same company in o rder to have the same design of T-shirt. 41. This explanation is not a credible one, since i t suggests that the Airport did not have any idea as to the numbers of temporary staff being taken on over a period of only three months. If this was the case, it indi cates poor management. 42. An alternative could be that two orders were pl aced to avoid having to organise a competitive bidding procedure, since the limit for single source procurements at that time was €1250. 43. The Security Official was also interviewed by t he ITF in connection with the two orders for t-shirts dated 1 July 2003 and 1 August 2003. He/she initially stated that the t-shirts were purchased for 70 students hi red in the summer of 2003. However, he/she later added having re-read the docu ments that they were also purchased for approximately 30 workers as well. 44. Whilst the requests do indicate the t-shirts t o have been purchased for technical services workers and students, both appear to relat e to “physical workers”. In view of the fact that the Security Official stated earlier in his/her interview that each student would be allocated 3 shirts and one pa ir of trousers. The number of t-shirts ordered -99 and 66- does not correspond wi th the number of employees. 45. In addition, the two requests specify that the shirts should be the same as the previous shirts of the existing workers. This requi rement suggests that Vendor 3, who had just won a tender for the provision of summ er uniforms to Pristina Airport in April 2003, had already been chosen as t he supplier. 46. The Security Official stated that he/she had be en asked to write a request for uniforms by the Divisional Manager following a conv ersation between them on the need for uniforms for the student workers. When asked why he/she had addressed the two requests to the PEAP Official rat her than the Divisional Manager, he/she replied that this was because the P EAP Official was his/her superior. However, neither of the requests mentions that the Security Official has spoken to the Divisional Manager. 8 47. The Security Official also indicated in his/her interview that he/she asked the Divisional Manager whether a company could be found to supply the t-shirts as it would be longer and more expensive if a tender proc edure took place. When questioned further about this response, he/she late r added “It was not foreseen to have a tender procedure in connection with the shirts for students and the part time workers.” 48. However, he/she could not recall who authorised the purchase of the t-shirts without a tender procedure. In summary, evidence fr om the two memoranda requesting t-shirts and from the Security Official suggest that two orders were placed within the space of one month with the compa ny Vendor 3 in order to avoid having to organise a competitive bidding proc edure, since the limit for single source procurements at that time was €1250. The documents also suggest that the party who authorised the purchase was the PEAP Official. VI. CONCLUSIONS 49. Whilst noting the comments in the capital expen diture approval that Vendor 3 was the only company that can provide the quality o f uniforms needed within the time limit, it is of concern that Vendor 3’s offer for winter uniforms in the sum of €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from Vendor 1 (€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850). However, this may in part be due to the fact that the Vendor 2 submitted an offer that did not c ontain all the required articles, whilst Vendor 1 produced uniforms of lower quality. 50. The only original bid documents seen by the ITF relating to the tender for the supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenanc e personnel for the winter season is the bid submitted by Vendor 3. Therefore, the ITF is unable to verify the findings of the evaluation committee resulting in the rejection of the bids submitted by the two other companies. 51. Evidence as to whether or not capital expenditu re was or was not obtained prior to signature of the contract is inconclusive, since the date on the contract, (6 December 2002) is contradicted by the routing slip dated 13 January 2003, which suggests that the letter of notification and contra ct may not have been signed until after 10 January 2003. The benefit of the dou bt must therefore be given to the Divisional Manager in this respect. 52. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms (€24,997) was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shop ping of €25,000. This raises concerns as to whether a competitive tender should have been held rather than competitive shopping procedure. 53. Whilst there are some doubts as to the quality of uniforms produced by Vendor 1, the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been just ified in view of its size and reputation in the region. The ITF does not therefor e find that the competitive shopping procedure was organised in such a manner a s to provide an unfair advantage to the existing supplier Vendor 3. 54. The evidence that companies submitting bids wer e irregularly requested to provide different quantities of items is not proven in the light of the response given in interview by the Procurement Officer. 9 55. In spite of the explanation given by the PEAP O fficial, evidence from the Security Official indicates that the two small orders for T- shirts were placed at a value of €1188 and €792, in order to avoid having to organis e a competitive shopping procedure, since the limit for single source procur ements at that time was €1250. It is likely that this was a conscious decision and constitutes a breach of Article 24 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999 /2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds. VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 56. It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take app ropriate action against PEAP Official based on the findings of this report. (IV0 4/275/01) 57. It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV undertak e a review of the procedures for signing and dating contracts to ensure clarity as t o the date on which a contract is executed.

INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants, which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are four specific allegations in this repo rt of investigation:  • tender specifications produced by the Pristina Air port for the cargo apron  extension were insufficiently specific and without clear instructions for bidder  contrary to UNMIK Finance Regulation 1999/2;  • three persons on the bid opening committee were al so part of the technical  evaluation committee contrary to procurement regula tions;  • the contract for the cargo apron extension was not  provided to the UNMIK  Office of the Legal Adviser for clearance; and  • it is alleged that the Vendor was allowed to certi fy its work as per the  requirements of the contract.      II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates, “Staff members shall uphold the highes t  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds  provides that:  Article 4 1  – “Competition among and participation in the proc urement process  shall be maximised.”  2  Article 4.1.1  – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders  shall be treated  fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each  Tender shall be judged on its merits.”  Article 4.3.3 . – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or e mployee of such  consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of  the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering  for a contract, including  but not limited to preparations of specifications o r any other Tender Documents,  no such consultant nor any principal officer or emp loyee of such consultant, no  “related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender  for or sponsor or participate in  the Tendering for such contract.”  Article 23.3  – “All tender documents shall contain complete inf ormation in neutral  and objective terms so that there can be full and f air competition among all  suppliers. In particular Tender Documents must incl ude the advertisement and ..”  Article 23.3.4  – “…full technical specifications, including the t ime limits for  delivery and completion.”    Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct . “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her  obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and the  Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuan ces, or to observe the standards of  conduct expected of an international civil servant,  may amount to unsatisfactory  conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of  disciplinary measures for misconduct.”    III. METHODOLOGY     3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.    IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised DOTI Official 1 (Department  of Transport and Infrastructure). The DOTI was late r known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs. DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  3  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the  armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer 1,  Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and lat er by a consultant from the  Consulting Company.    6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed. Under him were the PEAP Offi cial and ATCS Official  (Air Traffic Control Services).    7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.      V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     9. This part of the investigation relates to a tend er for a contract for the extension of  the Cargo Terminal Apron at Pristina Airport. The v alue of the contract was  €774,318.63.  Allegation 1     (Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo a pron did not comply with the  requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance A dministrative Instruction 1999/2  on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Bud get Funds, as they were  based on summary documents and did not include clea r instructions on drawings  and plans.)    10. A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluat ion Company to the PEAP  Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the  Evaluation Company was  commissioned to produce a preliminary design for th e Cargo Terminal at Pristina  Airport. The design also provided for the construct ion of the Cargo Apron  Extension.     11. A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five  companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the  Cargo Apron Extension. Four  companies submitted bids, and following an evaluati on, the contract was  awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for th e Cargo Apron Extension on  11 September 2001.    12. A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP date d 9 May 2001 indicates that it  submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include  what appears to be a section from the preliminary d esign documents produced by  the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a  section entitled ”Bills of  Quantities” from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design  documents.    4  13. An interoffice memorandum providing an “outstan ding issues update to Official  2”, from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the o ffice of Official 2 dated 18 May  2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers  were provided by companies  on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance.  However, a more likely explanation is the date of t he interoffice memorandum  has been incorrectly dated, since the document cont ains reference dates relating  to project “events” which post date 18 May 2001. At  paragraph 2b, the interoffice  memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation t o tender was based on  summary documents.     14. At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension eva luation report dated 2 August  2001, the committee notes that the bidding document s did not include clear  instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was  recommended that  negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Ve ndor, on further details of the  scope of works.    15. In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not  comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Admin istrative Instruction 1999/2  on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Bud get Funds.    16. When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied  with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Fi nance Administrative  Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget  Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer  was asked this question,  he/she would indicate that the tender specification s were technically deficient and  did not comply with Article 23.3.    17. DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical de tails of the Cargo Apron extension  project were taken from the cargo terminal study pr oduced by the Evaluation  Company and pasted into the tender document specifi cations. Thereafter, it was  up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate  that they could fulfil the  specification.    18. According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the  tender had been launched, had been angry with the E valuation Company for  allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of th eir study as the tender  specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also express ed concern at the method  used for preparing the tender documents, as from an  engineering point of view  the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. Howe ver, DOTI Official 2 stated that if  the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare th e tender documents, it  would have cost more money. He/she had therefore pr epared the tender  documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procur ement Official at the CPE to  review and help him with the procurement exercise.    19. Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer,  and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official,  as to the procurement  documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expre ssed the view that neither  the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Of ficer would have had the  technical expertise or time to review the technical  specifications.    5  20. DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no en gineering expert to support  his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a  fact that made his/her work  very difficult.    Allegations 2 & 3    (Specifically, three of the persons on the bid open ing committee and evaluation  committees were the same parties who should not hav e carried out both tasks.)    and     (The contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not  channelled through the Office  of the Legal Adviser.)       21. The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is si gned by three parties, who are  also listed as having attended the bid opening sess ion. This indicates that the  composition of the bid opening committee and the ev aluation committee  overlapped.    22. When asked about this issue in interview DOTI O fficial 2 confirmed that he/she  was both on the bid opening committee and was a mem ber of the evaluation  committee. He/she added that the people who evaluat ed the offers signed the  evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regu lations, which segregate the two  roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September  2001 indicates that the  contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been  channelled through the  Office of the Legal Adviser.     Allegation 4    (Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own tes t results to confirm the quality of its  own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflic t of interest.)    23. An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 t o the Procurement Official,  signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, in dicates that DOTI Official 1  authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memoran dum also adds that the work  was inadvertently not included in the original cont ract.    24. DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to p rogress the cargo apron tender,  he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/sh e added that only after the  tests were done could the tender go ahead. However,  the evaluation report at  paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature  of the ground does not  appear to have been included in the tender document s. In addition, a letter from  the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, bu t apparently not  received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, a ccording to a manuscript  note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it  carried out its own soil tests.     25. A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 Septe mber 2003 suggests that the  Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity repor t for the Cargo Apron,  thereby “self certifying” its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5,  6  reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay l iquidated damages in the event  that the “load-bearing “ capacity of the apron is l ess than foreseen in the contract,  upon completion of the work, the contract is silent  as to whom should carry out  the tests. However, it is questionable as to whethe r the Vendor should have  carried it out, since it presents a conflict of int erest.     26.  When asked about this in interview, the Divisi onal Manager stated:  “Without seeing any other documents, on the face of  it, it does appear that there  could be a conflict of interest here. But the repor t was produced by a professional  pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree  of integrity.”  27.  The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated  that he/she was unhappy about  the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she comm ented that the airport  engineer should have questioned it.    28. The ITF does not have sufficient technical know ledge to assess the adequacy of  the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divis ional Manager to Staff  Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the pos sibility that it was not up to  specification in certain areas.     VI. CONCLUSIONS     29. Evidence indicates that the tender documents fo r the cargo apron did not comply  with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative  Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget  Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear  instructions on drawings and plans. This appears to  have been due to an attempt  to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately  qualified staff.    30. In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender doc uments also appears to have been  due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the  tender documents rather than a deliberate act calcu lated to manipulate the tender  process.    31. DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for th e shortcomings in the tender  documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE mus t also bear a certain  amount of responsibility.    32. The shortcomings in the tender documents are li kely to have prejudiced some  companies in their decision as to submitting bids f or the tenders, since they may  not have been clear as to the detailed requirements  of the tender and therefore  submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a re sult.     33. Three persons are indicated to have both attend ed the bid opening session as  well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in  conflict with UN regulations.    34. Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo A pron Extension was not  channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.     7  35. Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its  own bearing capacity report for  the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work and presenting a potential  conflict of interest.     VII.

INTRODUCTION 1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered Accountants, which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina International Airport. 2. There are four specific allegations in this repo rt of investigation: • tender specifications produced by the Pristina Air port for the cargo apron extension were insufficiently specific and without clear instructions for bidder contrary to UNMIK Finance Regulation 1999/2; • three persons on the bid opening committee were al so part of the technical evaluation committee contrary to procurement regula tions; • the contract for the cargo apron extension was not provided to the UNMIK Office of the Legal Adviser for clearance; and • it is alleged that the Vendor was allowed to certi fy its work as per the requirements of the contract. II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS PROCEDURAL RULES Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24 dated 12 December 1999 as amended, states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be: a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments issued pursuant to those regulations; and b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.” UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b) stipulates, “Staff members shall uphold the highes t standards of efficiency, competence and integrity” UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds provides that: Article 4 1 – “Competition among and participation in the proc urement process shall be maximised.” 2 Article 4.1.1 – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders shall be treated fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each Tender shall be judged on its merits.” Article 4.3.3 . – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or e mployee of such consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering for a contract, including but not limited to preparations of specifications o r any other Tender Documents, no such consultant nor any principal officer or emp loyee of such consultant, no “related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender for or sponsor or participate in the Tendering for such contract.” Article 23.3 – “All tender documents shall contain complete inf ormation in neutral and objective terms so that there can be full and f air competition among all suppliers. In particular Tender Documents must incl ude the advertisement and ..” Article 23.3.4 – “…full technical specifications, including the t ime limits for delivery and completion.” Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct . “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuan ces, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary measures for misconduct.” III. METHODOLOGY 3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.

As Vendor 1 was  only able to  supply but not to  cable the FIDS, another tender had to  be launched for the FIDS  cabling. Winner of  this tender was Vendor 2.    Background Information    The Single Source Procurement (Purchase and supply of  FIDS) started on 17 October 2002  with a  written recommendation and justification by Vendor 2 Representative.  The purchase of   additional FIDS became necessary because of  the expansion of  the Passenger Terminal Building.  The already existing system had been provided by Ve ndor 1, therefore the Airport Management  decided to  choose Vendor 1 again.    The Capital Expenditure Approval and contract were signed on 13 December 2002 . The  procurement file does not show why Vendor 1 only de livered the FIDS but did not  cable it. The  need for cabling the FIDS resulted in another tende r that commenced in March 2004 . According  to the procurement file it appeared that Vendor 2 w on the Competitive Shopping tender with an  amount of  15.919 Euro.    Investigative details    Although Vendor 2 Representative was never employed  by the Airport the procurement file for  the FIDS supply contains two notes with regard to  recommendation and justification for the FIDS  purchase dated both on 17 October 2002  and signed by Vendor 2 Representative. One note  appears on white paper, the other one on Airport he aded notepaper.          2  The interviews of Vendor 2 Representative were cond ucted on 31 August 2004 and 14 September  2004. Vendor 2 Representative stated that he/she wa s probably asked by a PEAP Official to write  a recommendation and justification note for the FID S purchase.  Vendor 2 at that time worked at  the Airport for another project linked to the FIDS.  Vendor 2 was sub-contractor of Vendor 3  working at the Expansion of the Terminal Building a nd observing the need for more FIDS.    Vendor 2 Representative also stated that he/she wit h his/her company provided the Airport  procurement office with technical specifications fo r the FIDS cabling on request by the PEAP  Official. Vendor 2 Representative admitted that his /her involvement in the preparation of the  FIDS supply and cabling procurements and the later participation in the FIDS cabling tender by  his/her company put other competitors at a disadvan tage. To prepare technical specifications for a  tender and to take part in the same was according t o Vendor 2 Representative common practice  before the war.    During his/her interview on 9 September 2004 the PE AP official gave contradictory statements  with regard to his/her involvement in this case suc h as he/she probably had a meeting with  Vendor 2 Representative and the PEAP Engineer to di scuss the FIDS supply and as one result  Vendor 2 Representative wrote the appropriate recom mendation and justification note, but  elsewhere he/she denied to have ordered Vendor 2 Re presentative to do so.    The Airport Engineer was interviewed on 11 October 2004, as he/she is the responsible person to  suggest new projects to the Airport Management. The  Airport Engineer stated that he/she was at  no time involved in the FIDS purchase and did not r equest the support by Vendor 2  Representative with regard to recommend and justify  the FIDS supply. The Airport Engineer only  recommended the cabling of the FIDS in a note to th e Airport Management; all following  procedures are under the responsibility of the proc urement unit and the management.    The Sales Manager of Vendor 1 was interviewed on th e phone on 30 August 2004. Asked why  Vendor 1 did not provide with the cabling of the FI DS he/she stated that Vendor 1’s management  did not allow traveling to Kosovo at that time for security reasons. The Sales Manager of Vendor  1 also mentioned that the Airport's contact person with regard to the FIDS cabling was  for him/her Vendor 2 Representative.    Conclusions    Fact  is that Vendor 2 Representative was involved in the  procurement process for the FIDS  supply and the FIDS cabling despite he/she was not an employee at the Airport or KTA  procurement unit. The excuse by Vendor 2 Representa tive that such an involvement was common  practice before the war has nowadays definitely los t its validity.    It has to be assumed that Vendor 2 won the FIDS cab ling tender only due to the fact  that the company was definitely in advantage with r egard to advanced knowledge of the  technical requirements and had therefore sufficient  time to prepare a good bid in terms of the  price.    Although PEAP Official as the responsible official at that time denied that he/she had requested  Vendor 2 Representative support for the FIDS supply  and cabling procurements, Vendor 2  Representative granted the ITF that he/she acted on  PEAP Official’s request.    3  Nevertheless, PEAP official bears the overall respo nsibility for his/her department (PEAP), and  this investigation proved again that he/she did not  fully meet the requirements as manager in a  sensitive area like the Airport.    The entire matter has to be seen as an administrati ve irregularity. It is obvious that international  procurement rules had been breached but the Procure ment Regulation that was in force at that  time - Financial Agreement 1999/2 - does not indicate cases like described before.    Furthermore, to prove a possible case of corruption , there are not enough indications.    Recommendations    It is recommended that UNMIK, and in particular, th e KTA undertake the following actions:  Recommendation 1:  PEAP Official should be replaced  by a highly qualified manager whose  skills meet international management standards.    Recommendation 2:  The Airport staff responsible fo r procurement activity has to receive  adequate training in the handling of procurement ma tters and to adhere to all applicable  Procurement Regulations.    Recommendation 3:  The Airport staff responsible fo r procurement activity has to ensure that all  companies, consultancy agencies etc. providing supp ort in a procurement preparation is being  excluded to take part in the tender concerned and i n all other tenders linked to the initial one.","U N I T E D N A T I O N United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo N A T I O N S U N I E S Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo UNMIK Investigation Task Force Pristina, 22 November 2004 Case 0278/04 Pristina Airport - Alleged administrative irregular ity regarding an FIDS Tender Allegation An official of a non-Airport related company, suppo rted the procurement process for the supply of the Flat Information Display System (FIDS) by writi ng the recommendation and justification for a Single source procurement and also defined th e technical specifications.

INTRODUCTION     1.  In July 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) re ceived information alleging that  Pristina Airport failed to collect all revenues for  landing, handling and passenger tax.  The ITF was advised that the Airline, a regular use r of Pristina Airport, was not  paying the correct landing charges and airport pass enger tax. The information  indicated that the airline always paid its charges in cash. It was also alleged that there  was also no record of any airport passenger tax bei ng paid for passengers departing  with the airline.    II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    2.  The Airline flies to Pristina Airport from a Europe an Airport every Thursday carrying  Kosovar passengers who have been found to enter the  referred European state  illegally. The Airline is contracted with the forei gn state’s Immigration Department.  A representative of the Immigration Department and 25 or more “Securicor” security  staff routinely escort the passengers on the flight s to Pristina.     3.  On the return leg to the mentioned state, the Airli ne flight carries passengers from  Pristina, consisting of the returning Securicor esc orts, the representative of  Immigration, and in addition, a number of police of ficers of the concerned state  currently working for UNMIK CIVPOL. These CIVPOL off icers travel to the UK  without payment, but with the knowledge and approva l of both Airline and the U.K.  Immigration Department.     III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS    4.  ITF Investigators obtained a number of documents fr om Pristina Airport officials  including records of funds received from the Airlin e for the period January to June  2004. These funds are broken down into handling, la nding, airport passenger, and  departure tax. The schedule also lists the individu al Airport receipt number recorded  for each cash payment. There was no record of the A irline having paid airport tax.   ITF Report 262/04 2 5.  ITF Investigators spoke to both Official 1 and Offi cial 2 of the Airline and requested  copies of receipts issued by Pristina Airport in re spect of fees paid by the Airline to  the airport, as well as the Aircraft ""Load Sheets"" for May and June 2004. These  documents record details such as the weight of the aircraft including the MTOW  (maximum take off weight).    6.  Airline Official 1 explained that the Airline paid cash for handling and landing  charges to the Pristina Airport Passenger Handling Services Department on each  occasion his aircraft used the airport. Airline Off icial 1 explained that he/she had  endeavored to open a credit account with Pristina A irport, but without success.    7.  The ITF sought the assistance of the Security Offic er at Pristina Airport, in order to  monitor Airline passenger movements. On 22 July 200 4, ITF Investigators monitored  the Airline’s inward and outward flights and relate d airport activities. It was noted  that whilst the arriving Kosovar passengers went th rough immigration procedures  before entering into the arrivals lounge, the 25 se curity escorts and the representative  of the related Immigration Department remained airs ide at all times awaiting  instructions to return to the aircraft. They did no t enter the terminal building.    8.  Other passengers departing with the Airline met in the Airport public lounge. Their  identities were checked against a list provided by an UNMIK CIVPOL officer in  consultation with the Immigration representative. T hey then went through  conventional immigration and X-Ray searches and wer e escorted into the departure  lounge before boarding the Airline aircraft. They d id not, however, pass through  regular check-in procedures at any time.     9.  ITF Investigators reviewed all paperwork relating t o this flight. An Official of the  Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport, prov ided the receipt book used to  evidence cash payments for landing, handling and ai rport passenger taxes. It was  noted that other airlines, particularly those not v isiting Pristina on a regular basis, pay  in cash for handling services.     10.  Details shown on the records provided by Pristina A irport officials were reconciled  with this receipt book. The dates, amounts and brea kdown of charges were confirmed.  The pilot is required to sign the receipt book, and  the ITF verified the recorded  signature against the Airline ""Load Sheets"" as genu ine.    11.  The charges themselves, as calculated by the Airpor t Handling Services Department  for Airline flights, were scrutinized against the p ublished ""Price List for Basic Airport  Services"" issued on 1 January 2002.    12.  Details recorded on the ""Load Sheets"" confirmed the  handling charge of 1074 Euros  was also found to be correct. The landing charge of  €676.44 was, however, reduced  by 50% as this flight was identified as a “humanita rian flight” and as such qualified  for the discount. The Official of the Passenger Han dling Services, Pristina Airport  told the ITF Investigators that she regarded the re turning Kosovars as refugees and the  discount as appropriate. The ITF Investigators chec ked this matter with the Official of  the Airport General Services, who confirmed he/she was aware of this discount and  did not dispute this interpretation of the flight.    ITF Report 262/04 3 13.  ITF Investigators asked the Official of the Passeng er Handling Services, Pristina  Airport to describe the airport tax obligations for  such flights. The Official stated that  the tax of €15 per passenger is payable in respect of departing passengers only. The  Official explained that this tax is normally collec ted by the airlines using the check-in  facilities as part of normal boarding procedures. H e/She explained that the security  guards and U.K. Immigration staff who remained airs ide awaiting return to the UK  had not technically entered the Airport and as such  were not liable for airport taxes. In  respect of the other departing passengers, the Offi cial said there was no obligation for  the payment of this tax because neither the carrier  nor the passengers used the regular  check-in facilities of the Airport.     14.  The ITF reviewed the conventional check-in procedur es at the Pristina Airport and  confirmed they complied with observations provided by the Senior Official of the  Pristina Airport in response to a Management Letter  dated May 2004 on the 2003  Financial Audit from auditing company. An extract o f the advice states the following:     ’53. Passenger Fees   OBSERVATION  In the process of modernization of the Airport, Ent ity has acquired and implemented a  so-called automatic checking system. This system pr ovides accurate evidence of  passengers’ arriving and departure. However, PA has  still not integrated and/or  connected the automatic checking system with financ ial reporting      54. Establishment of an integrated system could pr ovide efficient monitoring  controls and accurate evidence, completeness and re conciliation of the number of  passenger recorded by the automatic checking system  and the revenue from  passenger fees in the financial statement.    Management Comment : Full integration will be achieved by the new system .  At  present, passenger and baggage check-in and boardin g is automatically connected to  the load sheet.  The load sheet contains all releva nt facts concerning the flight,  including type and quantity of passengers.  This re port is signed by Airport load  control staff, compared to a head-count on board th e aircraft conducted by aircraft  staff and is thereafter signed by the pilot before take-off.  A copy of this confirmed  report is used as a basis for invoicing. We use the  information that later will be  retrieved automatically by the new system.’     15.  The possible loss of revenue of departing passenger  taxes is another matter requiring  attention from airport management.     IV. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS    16.  There is no evidence that the Airline have sought t o avoid any charges levied by  Pristina Airport. All charges levied upon the Airli ne by Pristina Airport for incoming  and outgoing flights have been paid and receipts is sued. The charges applied to the  Airline flights are in accordance with listed charg es for services.     17.  The identification of the flight as ""humanitarian"" is a matter for closer review by  Airport Pristina management to ensure compliance wi th airport charges.   ITF Report 262/04 4 18.  The recently appointed Senior Official of the Prist ina Airport, when advised by the  ITF of the number of cash transactions, was unaware  that this practice continued  within the Passenger Handling Services Department.     19.  The information as to a credit arrangement for the Airline was also provided to the  Pristina Airport Senior Official by the ITF for his /her action.    20.  The charges shown in the ""Price List for Basic Airpo rt Services"" correspond with  those charged to the Airline. In addition, the audi t trail in respect of the cash handling  receipts, recording, and reconciliation with the ca shbooks and airport’s records  showed no discrepancies.     V.

INTRODUCTION 1. In July 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) re ceived information alleging that Pristina Airport failed to collect all revenues for landing, handling and passenger tax. The ITF was advised that the Airline, a regular use r of Pristina Airport, was not paying the correct landing charges and airport pass enger tax. The information indicated that the airline always paid its charges in cash. It was also alleged that there was also no record of any airport passenger tax bei ng paid for passengers departing with the airline. II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 2. The Airline flies to Pristina Airport from a Europe an Airport every Thursday carrying Kosovar passengers who have been found to enter the referred European state illegally. The Airline is contracted with the forei gn state’s Immigration Department. A representative of the Immigration Department and 25 or more “Securicor” security staff routinely escort the passengers on the flight s to Pristina. 3.

INTRODUCTION    1. On 29 April 2004 a Divisional Manager, UNMIK Pil lar IV, alleged that in October  2002, an envelope containing €5200 was left in the office of an official of Public  Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), by an unidentif ied individual. On 4 October  2002, a group of approximately 8 persons, including  a KTA Procurement  Specialist and Company 1 representative, had attend ed a meeting in his office  concerning a procurement contract for the building of a new car park at Pristina  International Airport.     II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    2. This case concerns an allegation of attempted br ibery and corruption as cited in  Article 344 of the Provisional Criminal Code of Kos ovo.    III. METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. (ITF) All relevant persons were  interviewed and all relevant documentation was obta ined and reviewed.    4. The KTA Procurement Specialist, who attended the  earlier meeting in the office  of the PEAP Official, was interviewed concerning th e incident. The Company 1  representative was not interviewed in this matter b y the ITF due to an ongoing  criminal investigation in which he/she is a witness . The ITF did not wish to  interfere in a judicial investigation.     5. The ITF made contact with the Acting Commissione r of Police in Kosovo in order  to ascertain the status of police enquiries into th e matter.      IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    6. On 29 April 2004, the Divisional Manager advised  the ITF of an incident which  had occurred “sometime in October 2002”, which he/s he “thought” he/she had  raised with the ITF previously. However, no evidenc e of this report could be  located nor recalled by any members of the ITF.    7. The Divisional Manager provided the ITF with a c opy of documents passed to an  UNMIK police officer, on 11 October 2002 at UNMIK P olice in Fush, Kosovo,  concerning the incident.    2 8. The documents consist of a letter from the Divis ional Manager to the UNMIK  Police Officer dated 11 October 2002, and a file no te from the PEAP Official,  dated 8 October 2002, to the Divisional Manager, de tailing the incident and  annexing a list of serial numbers of Euro notes tot alling €5,200 alleged to have  been left in the PEAP official’s diary in his offic e. .    9. The Divisional Manager explained that he/she was  away from the Airport from the  middle of September 2002 until the beginning of Oct ober 2002. Upon his/her  return, he/she was visited in his office by the PEA P Official. The latter informed  him/her that the previous Friday (believed to be 4 October 2002), a meeting had  been held in his (the PEAP Official’s) office, with  persons bidding for the  procurement contract for the new car parking area.    10. The note dated 8 October 2002 from the PEAP Off icial, indicates that the persons  who had attended a meeting were the Company 1 Repre sentative, an engineer  from the contractor “escavator” and the KTA Procure ment Specialist.    11. The following morning, the PEAP Official entere d his office and found an  unmarked, partly sealed envelope in his/her diary t hat contained €5,200 in cash.  The PEAP Official informed the Divisional Manager a bout the matter and  confirmed that there was no accompanying note, or e xplanation for the cash  being in his/her diary.    12. The Divisional Manager then reported the incide nt to his/her then chain of  command, and the matter was passed to the UNMIK pol ice.    V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     13. Analysis of the note written by the PEAP Offici al suggests that the company  referred to in his note as “escavator” is in fact C ompany 1, who won the contract  for the construction of the new car park at Pristin a Airport and whose  representative, attended a meeting in the PEAP Offi cial’s office one day prior to  the discovery of the money.    14. The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since  one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum”  such as €5000.    15. It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum f rom a former Airport  Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 2 6 September 2002, alleged  that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelop e of documents relating to  the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had  concluded and contrary to accepted procurement proc edures on the handling of  bids.   (This allegation is addressed in ITF Case No. 0274/ 04)    16. The KTA Procurement Specialist told the ITF tha t a meeting had been held in the  PEAP Official’s office with Company 1, attended by the Company 1  Representative and a Company 1 engineer. The purpos e of the meeting had  been to hand the contract for the new car park to C ompany 1 and the Company 1  Representative to sign it. The KTA Procurement Spec ialist indicated that there  were three or four other persons present, two of wh om, he/she thought may be  two staff members of Pristina Airport.  The KTA Pro curement Specialist added  that it was normal practice for the party winning t he bid to be invited to sign the  contract in this way.  3   17. The KTA Procurement Specialist also indicated t hat he/she did not see anything  placed in the PEAP Official’s office or diary, alth ough he/she later heard about  the incident. He/she expressed his/her opinion that  the incident had been  arranged to “break up” the contract with Company 1,  but did not indicate by  whom.    18. The ITF reviewed the letter from the Divisional  Manager to the UNMIK Police  Officer, which indicates that the matter was referr ed to the UNMIK police on 11  October 2002. The letter also records that the sum of €5,200 was handed to the  UNMIK Police Officer.    19. The UNMIK Police Officer, who is now based in I raq, told the ITF that he/she  served in Kosovo between June 2001 and November 200 2 and recalls the  incident being reported. He/she stated that at that  time he/she was serving with  the Border Police Investigations Unit and had assig ned this enquiry to his then  supervisor. The latter was unable to be interviewed  as he/she had left the  Mission.    20. ITF investigators visited the Border Boundary P olice and interviewed two current  investigators. Neither officer recalled the inciden t, but they made extensive  enquiries in an attempt to trace the police report and locate the €5,200. They  were unsuccessful on both counts.    21. On 27 September 2004, the ITF sent a letter to UNMIK Police Officer 2, in an  effort to determine what investigations had been un dertaken into the matter, the  result of those investigations and the whereabouts of the money.    22. The UNMIK Police Officer 2 indicated that Regio nal Crime Squad Pristina Region  was undertaking an investigation into the matter, w hich therefore, remains an  open investigation.     23. The ITF then contacted the Regional Crime Squad  and meetings were held with  two officials.    24. The ITF obtained a draft of the assigned office r’s report into the case, which  indicates that the case had been opened in 2004. Th e two-page report indicates  that the assigned officer had interviewed the PEAP Official, who had indicated  that he/she did not understand why the envelope wou ld have been left in his  office, as he/she had no responsibility for the car  park contract. The PEAP Official  also stated that he/she had contacted the Company 1  Representative, who  denied any knowledge of the envelope. The report al so indicates that statements  are to be taken from the Company 1 Representative a nd from the KTA  Procurement Specialist.     25. The Company 1 Representative was not interviewe d by the ITF due to his role as  a witness in an ongoing police investigation and an y investigative activity by the  ITF may have impacted upon that judicial inquiry.    26. The ITF has also been informed that the €5,200,  which is the subject of the  attempted bribery case, is still missing and a poli ce inquiry has commenced into  its disappearance.     4 VI. FINDINGS OF FACT    27.  Evidence adduced by the ITF gives rise to the possibility that an attempt was  made to make a corrupt payment to the PEAP Official  in October 2002.  Specifically, a sum of money was left in the diary of the PEAP Official in his office  at Pristina Airport. The matter was correctly passe d to UNMIK police in October  2002 and is currently under investigation.     28. The €5,200, which is the subject of the attempt ed bribery case, is missing and an  inquiry has been started into its disappearance.    VII. CONCLUSIONS     29. Evidence indicates that an attempt was made to make a corrupt payment to the  PEAP Official. No evidence exists as to why or by w hom.    30. The criminal case was passed to UNMIK police ov er two years ago and is  currently under investigation.    31. The ITF case is now closed in order to avoid an y duplication or interference of the  judicial investigation.","UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo Investigation Task Force Allegation of Possible Bribery at Pristina Airport (Case No. 0218/04) I.

The Divisional Manager explained that he/she was away from the Airport from the middle of September 2002 until the beginning of Oct ober 2002. Upon his/her return, he/she was visited in his office by the PEA P Official. The latter informed him/her that the previous Friday (believed to be 4 October 2002), a meeting had been held in his (the PEAP Official’s) office, with persons bidding for the procurement contract for the new car parking area. 10. The note dated 8 October 2002 from the PEAP Off icial, indicates that the persons who had attended a meeting were the Company 1 Repre sentative, an engineer from the contractor “escavator” and the KTA Procure ment Specialist. 11. The following morning, the PEAP Official entere d his office and found an unmarked, partly sealed envelope in his/her diary t hat contained €5,200 in cash. The PEAP Official informed the Divisional Manager a bout the matter and confirmed that there was no accompanying note, or e xplanation for the cash being in his/her diary. 12. The Divisional Manager then reported the incide nt to his/her then chain of command, and the matter was passed to the UNMIK pol ice. V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS 13. Analysis of the note written by the PEAP Offici al suggests that the company referred to in his note as “escavator” is in fact C ompany 1, who won the contract for the construction of the new car park at Pristin a Airport and whose representative, attended a meeting in the PEAP Offi cial’s office one day prior to the discovery of the money. 14. The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum” such as €5000. 15. It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum f rom a former Airport Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 2 6 September 2002, alleged that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelop e of documents relating to the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had concluded and contrary to accepted procurement proc edures on the handling of bids. (This allegation is addressed in ITF Case No. 0274/ 04) 16. The KTA Procurement Specialist told the ITF tha t a meeting had been held in the PEAP Official’s office with Company 1, attended by the Company 1 Representative and a Company 1 engineer. The purpos e of the meeting had been to hand the contract for the new car park to C ompany 1 and the Company 1 Representative to sign it. The KTA Procurement Spec ialist indicated that there were three or four other persons present, two of wh om, he/she thought may be two staff members of Pristina Airport. The KTA Pro curement Specialist added that it was normal practice for the party winning t he bid to be invited to sign the contract in this way. 3 17. The KTA Procurement Specialist also indicated t hat he/she did not see anything placed in the PEAP Official’s office or diary, alth ough he/she later heard about the incident. He/she expressed his/her opinion that the incident had been arranged to “break up” the contract with Company 1, but did not indicate by whom. 18. The ITF reviewed the letter from the Divisional Manager to the UNMIK Police Officer, which indicates that the matter was referr ed to the UNMIK police on 11 October 2002. The letter also records that the sum of €5,200 was handed to the UNMIK Police Officer. 19. The UNMIK Police Officer, who is now based in I raq, told the ITF that he/she served in Kosovo between June 2001 and November 200 2 and recalls the incident being reported. He/she stated that at that time he/she was serving with the Border Police Investigations Unit and had assig ned this enquiry to his then supervisor. The latter was unable to be interviewed as he/she had left the Mission. 20. ITF investigators visited the Border Boundary P olice and interviewed two current investigators. Neither officer recalled the inciden t, but they made extensive enquiries in an attempt to trace the police report and locate the €5,200. They were unsuccessful on both counts. 21. On 27 September 2004, the ITF sent a letter to UNMIK Police Officer 2, in an effort to determine what investigations had been un dertaken into the matter, the result of those investigations and the whereabouts of the money. 22. The UNMIK Police Officer 2 indicated that Regio nal Crime Squad Pristina Region was undertaking an investigation into the matter, w hich therefore, remains an open investigation. 23. The ITF then contacted the Regional Crime Squad and meetings were held with two officials. 24. The ITF obtained a draft of the assigned office r’s report into the case, which indicates that the case had been opened in 2004. Th e two-page report indicates that the assigned officer had interviewed the PEAP Official, who had indicated that he/she did not understand why the envelope wou ld have been left in his office, as he/she had no responsibility for the car park contract. The PEAP Official also stated that he/she had contacted the Company 1 Representative, who denied any knowledge of the envelope. The report al so indicates that statements are to be taken from the Company 1 Representative a nd from the KTA Procurement Specialist. 25. The Company 1 Representative was not interviewe d by the ITF due to his role as a witness in an ongoing police investigation and an y investigative activity by the ITF may have impacted upon that judicial inquiry. 26. The ITF has also been informed that the €5,200, which is the subject of the attempted bribery case, is still missing and a poli ce inquiry has commenced into its disappearance. 4 VI. FINDINGS OF FACT 27. Evidence adduced by the ITF gives rise to the possibility that an attempt was made to make a corrupt payment to the PEAP Official in October 2002. Specifically, a sum of money was left in the diary of the PEAP Official in his office at Pristina Airport. The matter was correctly passe d to UNMIK police in October 2002 and is currently under investigation. 28. The €5,200, which is the subject of the attempt ed bribery case, is missing and an inquiry has been started into its disappearance. VII. CONCLUSIONS 29. Evidence indicates that an attempt was made to make a corrupt payment to the PEAP Official. No evidence exists as to why or by w hom. 30. The criminal case was passed to UNMIK police ov er two years ago and is currently under investigation. 31. The ITF case is now closed in order to avoid an y duplication or interference of the judicial investigation.",Airport; Fush; Kosovo; Pristin a Airport; Pristina Airport; Pristina International Airport; raq,Divis; Kos ovo; UNMIK Pil lar IV; al; alth; xplanation,Airport Engineer; Company 1 Representative; Company 2; Divisional; Euro; ITF; KTA Procure ment Specialist; KTA Procurement Specialist; PEAP; PEAP Off; Public Enterprise Airport Pristina; Regio nal Crime Squad Pristina Region; The KTA Procurement Specialist; UNITED NATIONS PROCEDURAL; UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission; UNMIK; UNMIK P; poli ce inquiry; the Border Police Investigations Unit; the Investigation Task Force; the KTA Procurement Specialist; the PEA P Official; the Regional Crime Squad; the incide nt; tot alling; un,"0274/ 04; 1; 10; 11; 11 October 2002; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 18; 19; 2; 2 6 September 2002; 2 8; 20; 2004; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 27 September 2004; 28; 29; 29 April 2004; 3; 3 17; 30; 31; 4; 4 October 2002; 5; 5,200; 5200; 6; 7; 8 October 2002; 9; Article 344; November 200 2; October 2002; The following morning; approximately 8; as €5000; between June 2001; four; one day; the Provisional Criminal Code; the beginning of Oct ober 2002; the middle of September 2002; the previous Friday; three; two; two years ago",DECEPTIVE PRACTICE,0.999,"{'doc_id': '49.pdf', 'timestamp': '2025-01-31T23:35:07.858130', 'length': 9078, 'dates': ['29 April 2004', 'October 2002', '4 October 2002', '29 April 2004', 'October 2002', '11 October 2002', '2 8', '11 October 2002', '8 October 2002', 'the middle of September 2002', 'the beginning of Oct ober 2002', 'the previous Friday', '4 October 2002', '8 October 2002', 'one day', '2 6 September 2002', '0274/ 04', '11 October 2002', 'between June 2001', 'November 200 2', '27 September 2004', '2004', 'October 2002', 'October 2002', 'two years ago']}"

INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants, which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are four specific allegations in this repo rt of investigation:  • Extra work to the value of €25,935.74 was added to  the main contract without  any supporting documentation;  • The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA authorised the Annex  Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her  authorisation limit of €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated  from the normal procurement procedure;  • Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the  Annex agreement without  any supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works  or appropriate authorisation.  • The Divisional Manager of the Airports Sector KTA  failed to secure funding  approval prior to authorising expenditure for the a nnex agreement.    II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates, “Staff members shall uphold the highes t  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds  provides that:  Article 6.3 1–“ When the total estimated value of the contract does  not exceed  DM 50,000, (25,000 Euro) the Authorising Officer of  the requesting entity may  2 approve… the use of Direct-Single Source Procuremen t or Single–Source  Selection of Consultants.”  Article 8.2  –“Procuring entities shall maintain records of Pub lic Procurement in  sufficient details for the PPRB to verify that the provisions of this Instruction have  been followed.

METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.      IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,   including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport  and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs.  DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from a  member state’s armed forces specifically Airport En gineer I, Airport Engineer 2  and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant  from the Consulting Firm    3 6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under  him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS)  Official 1.    7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.      V. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     9. This report relates to Contract Ref ATCS/PA/COC W 02-02 for the construction of  garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) at the Pristina  Airport. It also deals with a further single source  contract Annex Agreement Ref  ACTS/PA/COC/W 02-02 for the supply of new offices, training room and  maintenance garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Ser vice. The value of the main  contract was €263,093  and the Annex Agreement €33, 927 .    Allegation 1  (Extra work to the value of €25 935.74 was added to  the main contract for the  construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services, without  any supporting documentation detailing the nature o f the extra works or appropriate  authorisation)    10. A bid evaluation report dated 30 September 2002  indicates that following an  evaluation of 9 bids the contract for the construct ion of garages and a parking  area for Air Traffic Control Services was awarded t o a the company in Pristina. A  bid evaluation report letter from the ATCS Procurem ent Officer at Pristina Airport  dated 1 October 2002 indicates that the Vendor was selected as having the  lowest price (€263,093) of the three companies sele cted for further evaluation.     11. A contract dated 30 September 2002 was signed w ith the Vendor by ATCS at  Pristina Airport on 11 October 2002.     12. A schedule of payments for the main contract in dicates that a sum of €25, 935.74  was added to the cost of the contract. However, the re are no documents in the  contract file indicating the nature of the extra wo rks or under what procedure they  were authorised.     13. When asked about this issue by the ITF, the Div isional Manager stated that  he/she would have expected to see a schedule of ext ra works in the contract file.  However, it was not in the file. He/she therefore c ould not state to what the extra  works related or under what procedure they were aut horised.    14. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the nature of  the works and the whereabouts  of supporting documentation, stated that the reques t for the extra expenditure  came from KFOR. He/she added that he/she was sure t here was a justification  4 from KFOR to carry out the extra works and that it had been agreed in all the  meetings between KFOR, UNMIK and the Airport.    15. On 6 October 2004, an ATCS Employee, provided I TF Investigators an  explanation for the extra work and produced a sprea dsheet detailing how the  figures had been determined.    16. According to the ATCS Employee, there had been an arithmetical error in the bill  of quantities for the main contract, which had not been picked up by the  evaluation committee. This had resulted in a reduct ion in the price of the contract  from €263,093 to €260,726.81.    17. ATCS Official 2 had subtracted the sum attribut able to this arithmetical error from  the contract, (€2366.19) and then carried out a rev iew of the specifications. The  review had resulted in a figure of €265,034.62 (€19 41.62 more than the stated  contract price of €263,093) due to items missed in the bill of quantities.    18. Additional ground stabilisation work totalling €23,994.08 was then added to the  specification review work, amounting to the differe nce between the original  contract price of €263,093 and the final invoice pr ice of €289,028.74, giving a  total of €25,935.57 for extra work.    19. This explanation was later confirmed by ATCS Of ficial 2 in a further meeting with  the ITF on 20 October 2004. ATCS Official 2 also co nfirmed that the extra work  had not been recorded in written form, as it follow ed a visit to the construction site  by the Divisional Manager and ATCS Official 1.     20. In summary, there are no documentary records to  support the extra works. The  only financial documentation on file authorising th e extra works appears to be a  signed schedule of payments, which includes the pro vision of €25,935.74 for  extra works.     Allegation 2  (The Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreem ent to proceed in spite of the  fact that the contract exceeded his authorisation l imit of €25, 000 to sign and  approve a contract which deviated from the normal p rocurement procedure under  Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruc tion 1999/2 on Public  Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds) ;  and  Allegation 3   (Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the  Annex Agreement without any  supporting documentation indicating either the natu re of the extra works or  appropriate authorisation)    21. A note from KFOR to ATCS Official 1 and the Div isional Manager dated 21  January 2003 attaching minutes of a meeting dated 7  January 2003, indicates  that an urgent request was made for construction of  a fire-fighters office and  maintenance offices, in anticipation of Iceland tak ing over from Italy as “Lead  Nation” in March 2003.     22. An annex agreement in the sum of €33,927 was si gned with the Vendor for  construction of a fire-fighters office and maintena nce offices on 7 February 2003,  5 supported by a justification from the Divisional Ma nager also dated 7 February  2003.     23. A schedule of payments dated 19 March 2003 rela ting to the annex agreement  indicates that a sum of €1,390 was added to the cos t of the contract. However,  there are no documents in the contract file indicat ing the nature of the extra  works or under what procedure they were authorised.      24. When asked about the extra payment in interview , the Divisional Manager  indicated that from the documents presented to him/ her (specifically the contract  file) he/she could not say what the extra works wer e. He/she added that without  looking at the works covered by the contract he/she  could not know whether or  not there was any provision for extra expenditure.    25. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the extra pay ment in interview stated that  he/she would have to check airport administration r ecords and provide this  information. On 27 September 2004, ATCS Official 1 had a meeting with the ITF  at which he/she indicated that the extra work relat ed to a request from KFOR for  a stair rail and the creation of a storage space un der the stairs of the training  offices for fire fighter’s breathing equipment, tog ether with office partitioning for  the fire-fighter’s offices. In support of this, he/ she produced a copy of a  manuscript diary entry and a note dated 27 Septembe r 2004, drawn up by the  Vendor, listing these items as the extra works carr ied out. This indicates that  there was no supporting documentation for the extra  work when it was carried  out. The only financial documentation on file autho rising the extra works appears  to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes  the provision of €1,390 for  extra works.     Allegation 4  (It is alleged that the Divisional Manager failed t o secure funding approval prior to  authorising expenditure for the Annex Agreement to construct a fire-fighters office  and maintenance offices)    26. A capital expenditure approval dated 4 March 20 03 shows that the Divisional  Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed i n spite of the fact that the  contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €2 5,000. In addition, the  document indicates that the work had already been c ompleted by the time that  financial approval was sought for the expenditure.      VI. CONCLUSIONS    27. There is no supporting documentation or appropr iate authorisation for the extra  works in the sum of €25,935.74 arising from the mai n contract for the  construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services. This is  contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administra tive Instruction 1999/2 on  Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget  Funds.    28.  The same is applicable to the extra works in t he sum of €1,390 relating to the  Annex Agreement for construction of a fire-fighters  office and maintenance  offices. This is again contrary to Article 8.2 of U NMIK Finance Administrative  Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget  Funds.  6   29. In addition, the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed  in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his /her authorisation limit of  €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviat ed from the normal  procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Fi nance Administrative  Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget  Fund.    30. Evidence indicates that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval  prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agre ement to construct a fire- fighters office and maintenance offices. This is co ntrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK  Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public  Procurement using Kosovo  Consolidated Budget Funds.      31. In mitigation, the construction of a fire-fight ers office and maintenance offices do  appear to have been required as a matter of urgency .      VII. RECOMMENDATIONS    32. The ITF recommends the following;    Given that the Divisional Manager has left the Miss ion and cannot be sanctioned for  his/her actions, it is recommended that UNMIK (Pill ar IV) should place a copy of this  report on his/her personnel file for future referen ce. (IV04/276/01)    It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take appropr iate action against ATCS  Official 2 as the official having responsibility fo r the ATCS for his/her failure to ensure  that the extra work was adequately documented and a uthorised.

This report relates to Contract Ref ATCS/PA/COC W 02-02 for the construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) at the Pristina Airport. It also deals with a further single source contract Annex Agreement Ref ACTS/PA/COC/W 02-02 for the supply of new offices, training room and maintenance garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Ser vice. The value of the main contract was €263,093 and the Annex Agreement €33, 927 . Allegation 1 (Extra work to the value of €25 935.74 was added to the main contract for the construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services, without any supporting documentation detailing the nature o f the extra works or appropriate authorisation) 10. A bid evaluation report dated 30 September 2002 indicates that following an evaluation of 9 bids the contract for the construct ion of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services was awarded t o a the company in Pristina. A bid evaluation report letter from the ATCS Procurem ent Officer at Pristina Airport dated 1 October 2002 indicates that the Vendor was selected as having the lowest price (€263,093) of the three companies sele cted for further evaluation. 11. A contract dated 30 September 2002 was signed w ith the Vendor by ATCS at Pristina Airport on 11 October 2002. 12. A schedule of payments for the main contract in dicates that a sum of €25, 935.74 was added to the cost of the contract. However, the re are no documents in the contract file indicating the nature of the extra wo rks or under what procedure they were authorised. 13. When asked about this issue by the ITF, the Div isional Manager stated that he/she would have expected to see a schedule of ext ra works in the contract file. However, it was not in the file. He/she therefore c ould not state to what the extra works related or under what procedure they were aut horised. 14. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the nature of the works and the whereabouts of supporting documentation, stated that the reques t for the extra expenditure came from KFOR. He/she added that he/she was sure t here was a justification 4 from KFOR to carry out the extra works and that it had been agreed in all the meetings between KFOR, UNMIK and the Airport. 15. On 6 October 2004, an ATCS Employee, provided I TF Investigators an explanation for the extra work and produced a sprea dsheet detailing how the figures had been determined. 16. According to the ATCS Employee, there had been an arithmetical error in the bill of quantities for the main contract, which had not been picked up by the evaluation committee. This had resulted in a reduct ion in the price of the contract from €263,093 to €260,726.81. 17. ATCS Official 2 had subtracted the sum attribut able to this arithmetical error from the contract, (€2366.19) and then carried out a rev iew of the specifications. The review had resulted in a figure of €265,034.62 (€19 41.62 more than the stated contract price of €263,093) due to items missed in the bill of quantities. 18. Additional ground stabilisation work totalling €23,994.08 was then added to the specification review work, amounting to the differe nce between the original contract price of €263,093 and the final invoice pr ice of €289,028.74, giving a total of €25,935.57 for extra work. 19. This explanation was later confirmed by ATCS Of ficial 2 in a further meeting with the ITF on 20 October 2004. ATCS Official 2 also co nfirmed that the extra work had not been recorded in written form, as it follow ed a visit to the construction site by the Divisional Manager and ATCS Official 1. 20. In summary, there are no documentary records to support the extra works. The only financial documentation on file authorising th e extra works appears to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes the pro vision of €25,935.74 for extra works. Allegation 2 (The Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreem ent to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his authorisation l imit of €25, 000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated from the normal p rocurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruc tion 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds) ; and Allegation 3 (Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the Annex Agreement without any supporting documentation indicating either the natu re of the extra works or appropriate authorisation) 21. A note from KFOR to ATCS Official 1 and the Div isional Manager dated 21 January 2003 attaching minutes of a meeting dated 7 January 2003, indicates that an urgent request was made for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices, in anticipation of Iceland tak ing over from Italy as “Lead Nation” in March 2003. 22. An annex agreement in the sum of €33,927 was si gned with the Vendor for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintena nce offices on 7 February 2003, 5 supported by a justification from the Divisional Ma nager also dated 7 February 2003. 23. A schedule of payments dated 19 March 2003 rela ting to the annex agreement indicates that a sum of €1,390 was added to the cos t of the contract. However, there are no documents in the contract file indicat ing the nature of the extra works or under what procedure they were authorised. 24. When asked about the extra payment in interview , the Divisional Manager indicated that from the documents presented to him/ her (specifically the contract file) he/she could not say what the extra works wer e. He/she added that without looking at the works covered by the contract he/she could not know whether or not there was any provision for extra expenditure. 25. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the extra pay ment in interview stated that he/she would have to check airport administration r ecords and provide this information. On 27 September 2004, ATCS Official 1 had a meeting with the ITF at which he/she indicated that the extra work relat ed to a request from KFOR for a stair rail and the creation of a storage space un der the stairs of the training offices for fire fighter’s breathing equipment, tog ether with office partitioning for the fire-fighter’s offices. In support of this, he/ she produced a copy of a manuscript diary entry and a note dated 27 Septembe r 2004, drawn up by the Vendor, listing these items as the extra works carr ied out. This indicates that there was no supporting documentation for the extra work when it was carried out. The only financial documentation on file autho rising the extra works appears to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €1,390 for extra works. Allegation 4 (It is alleged that the Divisional Manager failed t o secure funding approval prior to authorising expenditure for the Annex Agreement to construct a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices) 26. A capital expenditure approval dated 4 March 20 03 shows that the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed i n spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €2 5,000. In addition, the document indicates that the work had already been c ompleted by the time that financial approval was sought for the expenditure. VI. CONCLUSIONS 27. There is no supporting documentation or appropr iate authorisation for the extra works in the sum of €25,935.74 arising from the mai n contract for the construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services. This is contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administra tive Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds. 28. The same is applicable to the extra works in t he sum of €1,390 relating to the Annex Agreement for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices. This is again contrary to Article 8.2 of U NMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget Funds. 6 29. In addition, the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his /her authorisation limit of €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviat ed from the normal procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Fi nance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Koso vo Consolidated Budget Fund. 30. Evidence indicates that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agre ement to construct a fire- fighters office and maintenance offices. This is co ntrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds. 31. In mitigation, the construction of a fire-fight ers office and maintenance offices do appear to have been required as a matter of urgency . VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 32. The ITF recommends the following; Given that the Divisional Manager has left the Miss ion and cannot be sanctioned for his/her actions, it is recommended that UNMIK (Pill ar IV) should place a copy of this report on his/her personnel file for future referen ce. (IV04/276/01) It is recommended that UNMIK Pillar IV take appropr iate action against ATCS Official 2 as the official having responsibility fo r the ATCS for his/her failure to ensure that the extra work was adequately documented and a uthorised.

51.pdf,"UNITED NATIONS  United Nations Interim  Administration Mission  in Kosovo    UNMIK NATIONS UNIES  Mission d’Administration  Intérimaire des Nations Unies  au Kosovo     INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE    Allegation of fraud in handling and accounting of C argo   at Pristina Airport (Case No. 0192/04)       I. Introduction     1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) received a re port that the Cargo Department at  Pristina Airport had improperly sought payment for importation and storage of goods  owned by the Company. It was further alleged that a n amount of €8,000.00 was sought  and received by an official (Official 1) of the Pri stina Airport, which was illegal and  therefore not recorded in the accounts of the Airpo rt.    2. After the ITF conducted a preliminary investigat ion into this allegation, prima  facie  evidence of a crime was identified and the case wa s referred to the Department of  Justice, Pillar I, UNMIK, on July 22 nd , 2004 for further judicial action. This report is a  summary of the information adduced during the inves tigation.      II. Background     3. ITF Investigators met with the Company Represent ative, who explained that a  part of his business involves the importation and m arketing of LED display equipment.  The Company consists of 4 partners:    • Partner 1  • Partner 2  • Partner 3  • Partner 4    4. The above company partners agreed to the followi ng regarding the various  payments to be effected as follows:    • Partner 2 and Partner 3 were to pay the total price  of all the goods;  • Partner 1 was to pay everything regarding VAT, Cust om Duties, Local Taxes and  Storage.      III. THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF   AIRPORT PRISTINA CARGO OFFICIALS    5. In general terms, airport officials are required  to act in the best interests of Airport  Pristina, a Kosovo Publicly Owned Enterprise (POE),  while performing their duties and  establishing and maintaining a responsible and tran sparent business framework in which  Airport Pristina can function. All Cargo Department  officials are obliged to follow the  applicable law, and internal Rules, Regulations and  Instructions, when dealing with  Airport Pristina assets, resources and facilities.      6. Official 2 was responsible for the daily control  and management of the Cargo  section, including its assets and resources. He had  the responsibility to ensure that all  contracts concluded on behalf of Airport Pristina r egarding storage fees payable by  importers complied with the applicable law, regulat ions and instructions, and that they  were subject to full and fair competition, openness  and transparency and free from  conflict of interest and corruption. His/her duty w as to conduct the affairs of Airport  Pristina as a senior official with the utmost integ rity and transparency and to be fully  accountable to the Board of Airport Pristina.    7. It was Official 2’s responsibility to ensure tha t storage fees were paid and a record  of the payments be kept. The procedure for recordin g payments is that the airway bill  with a customs stamp should have been provided to t he Finance Officer whereby he/she  then calculates the storage fees owed. Before indiv iduals or companies were allowed to  retrieve their goods, this fee had to be paid pursu ant to an official invoice. In this instant  case, there is no record of such an invoice or any such payment. The absence of such a  record is highly unusual and establishes that monie s owed to the airport were not received  in this case.    8. Official 1  worked in the Cargo Handling Office at the Airport.  As with Official 2,  it was Official 1’s duty to ensure that all payment s made by customers of the airport  complied with the applicable regulations and instru ctions.         III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS    9. A consignment of “LED Display equipment and acce ssories” for the Company  arrived at the airport via Airline 1 on 26 December  2003, and consisted of four pallets  containing 27 packages with a total weight of 976 k g. These goods were imported from  Beirut and were accompanied by an Air Waybill.    10. The Company Representative was advised by Partn er 2 of the consignment’s  arrival. Partner 2 was also the person that handed over the Air Waybill to the Company  Representative.   11. At the time the consignment arrived in Kosovo, the Company did not have  permission to erect the LED screen on any city buil ding for advertisement purposes as  they had intended. This authorization was granted s ometime later, circa March/April  2004.    12. The merchandise in question was paid for and cl eared on the 15 th  of March 2004,  by the nominated Shipping Agent. The same Agent, on  behalf of the Company, paid a  total amount of €11,581.00, VAT and Customs Duties included.    13. Once all the payments had been effected, the Co mpany Representative went to the  Cargo Building to pick up his goods, but according to his statements, he/she was  approached by Official 1, who advised the Company R epresentative that he/she was now  required to pay the amount of €32,800.00 that inclu ded a storage charge for the period 26  December 2003 to 15 March 2004.    14. Partner 2 was astonished at this excessive char ge for storage. At this point, the  Company management agreed to leave the goods in sto rage and decide on what action to  take. They identified the possibility of returning the goods to their place of origin, due to  the fact that the storage would have cost them near ly as much as the price of the screen  (US$54,000.00).     15. Official 1 then advised the Company Representat ive that he would do everything  in his/her power to assist in settling this situati on, including an offer to lower the storage  charge. Sometime thereafter, Official 1 advised the  Company Representative that he/she  was able to decrease the storage charge to €8,000.0 0 based on his/her position and  connections at the Airport.    16. The Company management accepted the new offer a nd agreed to pay the lower  storage charge of €8.000.00. However, due to the fa ct that Partner 1 did not have  €8,000.00 in cash, he/she commenced a search amongs t his/her friends for the money.  Subsequently, Partner 1 was able to raise the money  to pay both the Custom Excise and  Airport Storage fees.     17. On the 16 th  of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the  Company  Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport t o hand it to Official 1. The Company  Representative stated that the hand-over of the cas h to Official 1 took place outside the  airport terminal gate.  The Airport X-Ray Operator,  who observed the meeting between  the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting  took place as stated.    18. ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official  documentation in relation to the Company merchandis e. No trace of the payment of the  €8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department accou nt books for 2003 or 2004.   19. According to the tariff list that the Finance O fficer of the Cargo Section provided  to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for  storage fees from the 23 rd  of December 2003 to 15 th  of March 2004.    20. In view of the above, ITF Investigators intervi ewed Official 2 who offered no  justifiable explanation as to why no payment had be en effected with respect to the  Company goods. He/she simply repeated that the good s were confiscated from the  Customs Service and that just a minor payment of st orage fees should have occurred.  Unfortunately, no trace of payment (current officia l storage price list payment or the  minor payment that Official 2 declared in his/her o fficial interview) was detected by the  ITF nor provided by Official 2. Further inquiries c arried out by the ITF on 6 July 2004 at  Pristina Airport Customs Offices and at Pristina Cu stoms Services Headquarters,  disclosed that the merchandise did indeed enter the  airport storage on 26 December 2003  and left on 15 March 2004. According to two staff m embers, the Company merchandise  was not confiscated based on a request from Customs . The ITF found that the Company  paid a total amount of €11,581.00 for VAT and Custo ms Duties.      21. On July 12 th  2004, ITF Investigators interviewed Partner 4 conf irmed that the first  requested amount was €32,000.00, which was later ch anged to the agreed sum of  €8,000.00. He/she added that he/she received a stra nge phone call from a staff member of  Airline 2 Pristina Office on 9 July 2004, advising him/her to urgently make contact with  Official 2 on his/her mobile telephone, because Off icial 2 urgently needed to speak with  Partner 4. According to Partner 4’s statement, he/s he called Official 2, who asked for an  appointment in order to discuss “a certain issue”. Partner 4 said he/she replied that there  was no need to continue this conversation, as he/sh e knew that Official 2 was trying to  influence any statements by Partner 4 that he/she m ay provide to any future inquiries  from an investigative body. Partner 4 stated to the  ITF that he/she advised the staff  member of Airline 2 of his already scheduled appoin tment with ITF Investigators on the  following Monday and that he/she was prepared to te ll all he knew on the matter.  In view  of all the collected data and evidence, the ITF dec ided to refer the case to the Department  of Justice.     IV. CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS    22. Based on the referral from the ITF to the Depar tment of Justice on 26 July 2004,  arrest warrants were  issued against Official 1 and Official 2. Each char ge is detailed  below:     Count 1      That between the dates 14 th  March 2004 and 16 th  March 2004 inclusive, Official 1 and  Official 2  acting in their capacity as officials of Airport Pr istina, and acting in complicity  with the intention to obtain an unlawful material b enefit, presented a representative of the  Company with a false statement of account claiming reduced storage fees, and in so  doing, misled an authorized person to carry out an unlawful payment, thereby committing the offence of Fraud in Service  in violation of  Article 215, (1) and (2) of the Ko sovo  Criminal Code (KCC) punishable by imprisonment of o ne to ten years    {equivalent to Fraud in Office  contrary to Article 341 (1) and (2) of Provisional Kosovo  Criminal Code (PCCK)};    and Complicity, in violation of Article 22 of Criminal Code of SFRY ,( equivalent to   Co- Perpetration , in violation of PCCK Article 23)    Count 2      That between the dates 14 th  March 2004 and 16 th  March 2004 inclusive Official 1 and  Official 2 with the intent to obtain an unlawful ma terial benefit for themselves  appropriated money (approx. 8,000.00 Euros) from th e Company, amount which was  allegedly decreased from an initial sum of 32,800.0 0 Euros to be paid to the Airport for  storage fees for goods kept in the Cargo section of  the Airport from 24.12.03 until  15.3.2004, thereby committing the offence of Embezzlement , in violation of Article 219  para. 1 and 3 of the KCC punishable by imprisonment  of one to ten years    (equivalent to Misappropriation in Office , in violation of Article 340, (1) and (3) of the  PCCK)    and  Complicity, in violation of Article 22 of Criminal Code of SFRY  ( equivalent Co - Perpetration , in violation of PCCK Article 23.)

V. CONCLUSION  23. Given that the judicial process is ongoing and now rests with the Department of  Justice, it is highly recommended that the informat ion contained in this report be  carefully protected from inappropriate disclosure. The two Pristina Airport staff members  are under suspension and awaiting trial. Therefore,  this information is to be treated as highly confidential and should not be disseminated to any other party without the consent  of the competent Judicial Authorities.   VI. RECOMMENDATIONS  24. The ITF offers the following recommendations:  Recommendation 1 : The ITF recommends that UNMIK Pillar IV take no ad ministrative  action against Official 1 and Official 2 pending th e resolution of their respective cases by  the Department of Justice (IV04/192/01).  Recommendation 2 :  The ITF recommends that UNMIK Pillar IV take appr opriate  disciplinary action against Official 1 if he/she is  not criminally charged or sentenced by  the competent authorities (IV04/192/02).  Recommendation 3 : The ITF recommends that UNMIK Pillar IV take appro priate  disciplinary action against Official 2 if he/she is  not criminally charged or sentenced by  the competent authorities (IV04/192/03).","UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE Allegation of fraud in handling and accounting of C argo at Pristina Airport (Case No. 0192/04) I.

A consignment of “LED Display equipment and acce ssories” for the Company arrived at the airport via Airline 1 on 26 December 2003, and consisted of four pallets containing 27 packages with a total weight of 976 k g. These goods were imported from Beirut and were accompanied by an Air Waybill. 10. The Company Representative was advised by Partn er 2 of the consignment’s arrival. Partner 2 was also the person that handed over the Air Waybill to the Company Representative. 11. At the time the consignment arrived in Kosovo, the Company did not have permission to erect the LED screen on any city buil ding for advertisement purposes as they had intended. This authorization was granted s ometime later, circa March/April 2004. 12. The merchandise in question was paid for and cl eared on the 15 th of March 2004, by the nominated Shipping Agent. The same Agent, on behalf of the Company, paid a total amount of €11,581.00, VAT and Customs Duties included. 13. Once all the payments had been effected, the Co mpany Representative went to the Cargo Building to pick up his goods, but according to his statements, he/she was approached by Official 1, who advised the Company R epresentative that he/she was now required to pay the amount of €32,800.00 that inclu ded a storage charge for the period 26 December 2003 to 15 March 2004. 14. Partner 2 was astonished at this excessive char ge for storage. At this point, the Company management agreed to leave the goods in sto rage and decide on what action to take. They identified the possibility of returning the goods to their place of origin, due to the fact that the storage would have cost them near ly as much as the price of the screen (US$54,000.00). 15. Official 1 then advised the Company Representat ive that he would do everything in his/her power to assist in settling this situati on, including an offer to lower the storage charge. Sometime thereafter, Official 1 advised the Company Representative that he/she was able to decrease the storage charge to €8,000.0 0 based on his/her position and connections at the Airport. 16. The Company management accepted the new offer a nd agreed to pay the lower storage charge of €8.000.00. However, due to the fa ct that Partner 1 did not have €8,000.00 in cash, he/she commenced a search amongs t his/her friends for the money. Subsequently, Partner 1 was able to raise the money to pay both the Custom Excise and Airport Storage fees. 17. On the 16 th of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the Company Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport t o hand it to Official 1. The Company Representative stated that the hand-over of the cas h to Official 1 took place outside the airport terminal gate. The Airport X-Ray Operator, who observed the meeting between the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated. 18. ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official documentation in relation to the Company merchandis e. No trace of the payment of the €8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department accou nt books for 2003 or 2004. 19. According to the tariff list that the Finance O fficer of the Cargo Section provided to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for storage fees from the 23 rd of December 2003 to 15 th of March 2004. 20. In view of the above, ITF Investigators intervi ewed Official 2 who offered no justifiable explanation as to why no payment had be en effected with respect to the Company goods. He/she simply repeated that the good s were confiscated from the Customs Service and that just a minor payment of st orage fees should have occurred. Unfortunately, no trace of payment (current officia l storage price list payment or the minor payment that Official 2 declared in his/her o fficial interview) was detected by the ITF nor provided by Official 2. Further inquiries c arried out by the ITF on 6 July 2004 at Pristina Airport Customs Offices and at Pristina Cu stoms Services Headquarters, disclosed that the merchandise did indeed enter the airport storage on 26 December 2003 and left on 15 March 2004. According to two staff m embers, the Company merchandise was not confiscated based on a request from Customs . The ITF found that the Company paid a total amount of €11,581.00 for VAT and Custo ms Duties. 21. On July 12 th 2004, ITF Investigators interviewed Partner 4 conf irmed that the first requested amount was €32,000.00, which was later ch anged to the agreed sum of €8,000.00. He/she added that he/she received a stra nge phone call from a staff member of Airline 2 Pristina Office on 9 July 2004, advising him/her to urgently make contact with Official 2 on his/her mobile telephone, because Off icial 2 urgently needed to speak with Partner 4. According to Partner 4’s statement, he/s he called Official 2, who asked for an appointment in order to discuss “a certain issue”. Partner 4 said he/she replied that there was no need to continue this conversation, as he/sh e knew that Official 2 was trying to influence any statements by Partner 4 that he/she m ay provide to any future inquiries from an investigative body. Partner 4 stated to the ITF that he/she advised the staff member of Airline 2 of his already scheduled appoin tment with ITF Investigators on the following Monday and that he/she was prepared to te ll all he knew on the matter. In view of all the collected data and evidence, the ITF dec ided to refer the case to the Department of Justice. IV. CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS 22. Based on the referral from the ITF to the Depar tment of Justice on 26 July 2004, arrest warrants were issued against Official 1 and Official 2.

INTRODUCTION    1. The Investigation Task Force (ITF) Kosovo conducted  an investigation into  the circumstances surrounding a UNMIK Bank Account opened at a Bank in  Pristina. This investigation was triggered by a for ensic audit report of Public  Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP) released in Febr uary 2003 by the  Chartered Accountants.     2. The activities of the Pristina Airport fall under t he control of the Kosovo Trust  Agency (KTA) and UNMIK Pillar IV, which is administ ered by the European  Union. Investigations into allegations of fraud and  corruption involving  UNMIK, its pillars and other organizational structu res as well as the  Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and independent bodies  and offices established pursuant to the Constitutio nal Framework for  Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo fall within t he purview of ITF as laid  out by the Executive Decision on the Establishment of the Investigation Task  Force UNMIK/ED/2003/16, dated 21 October 2003.    II.  APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS:     3. Pursuant to the authority given to The Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary-General, under United Nations Security Co uncil resolution 1244  (1999)  of 10 June 1999, taking into account United Nation s Interim  Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) Regulation No. 1999/ 1 of 25 July  1999 on the Authority of the Interim Administration  in Kosovo, for the  purpose of defining the law applicable in Kosovo, t he SRSG promulgated that  the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:    a. The regulations promulgated by the Special Represen tative of the  Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments issued  thereunder; and   b. The law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.    4. The ITF Investigators considered possible breaches of the Provisional  Criminal Code of Kosovo , especially Article 339 (Abusing Official Position  of  Authority); Article 340 (Misappropriation in Office ) and Article 341 (Fraud in  Office).     2 -3 III.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION    5. The DCDM Audit Report 2002/3 highlighted a possible  problem with a  UNMIK Bank Account, which has been termed the “Comp any Account”. It  was alleged that there was only one signatory to th is account (Staff Member 1)  and that the interest from this account was going t o an unidentified private  account.     IV.  INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS    6. The ITF Investigators established that on 13 and 20  July 2001, UNMIK and the  Company signed a contract “Relating to the Supply of Aviation Fuel and the  Refuelling of Commercial Civilian Aircraft at Prist ina Airport ”. As of 03 March  2004, this Contract was amended, so that the Compan y also commenced  supplying aviation fuel and refuelling services to military and non- commercial aircrafts.    7. Based on this contract, the Company has been making  payments to UNMIK  that are being deposited to an UNMIK Bank Subject A ccount, opened at a  Bank in Pristina. This is a sub-account of the main  UNMIK Bank Account.    8. The Bank Account was opened with the Bank on 11 Oct ober 2001 and the first  payment was made by way of an incoming Internationa l Money Transfer  (IMT) in the sum of € 45,105.23 on 17 April 2002. T he most recent payment  made to this account was made on 24 January 2005 by  the Company in the  sum of € 8,578.42. The actual balance on this bank account as of 04 March 2005  is € 537,536.90.    9. Initially Staff Member 1, was the “A” signatory of this account. On 14 July  2004, his/her Supervisor, formally notified Staff M ember 2, that he/she was  an “A” signatory to this account with Staff Member 3 and Staff Member 4   being “B” signatories. Staff Member 2 was also noti fied that withdrawals from  this account could not be made without the joint ap proval of either the  Supervisor, Staff Member 5 or Staff Member 6. Staff  Member 2 was also  informed that the Account was currently an UNMIK Ba nk Account and that  Pristina Airport did not have full control over the  use of this account.     10. The ITF Investigators found no evidence that funds deposited in this UNMIK  Bank Account were generated by illegal activities. In fact this investigation  confirmed that all funds deposited on this account were generated by a  legitimate business sanctioned by a contract betwee n UNMIK and the  Company.     11. The allegation that had been made by the Chartered Accountants - “interest  from this account was going to an unidentified priv ate account ” was found to be  without merit, given that the terms and conditions this UNMIK Bank Account  does not generate any interest.  The ITF Investigat ors further established that  there were no withdrawals from this Account; the on ly debits were a variety  of bank charges.   3 -3   12. The ITF Investigation identified a long running dis pute related to the legal  ownership of the money deposited to this UNMIK Bank  Account. The funds  deposited to this account are being generated exclu sively from the Pristina  Airport through a contract between UNMIK and Air BP . Despite numerous  inquiries that have been made by the Pristina Airpo rt General Services  Department, no definitive answer has been provided as to who is the owner  of this money. As a result, a sum of € 537,536.90 i s “sitting” in this UNMIK  Account and it does not generate any interest payme nts. It should be noted  that the Pristina Airport now has to borrow money t o run its day-to-day  operations. This situation would suggest that the U NMIK Senior  Management team should resolve the legal ownership question as soon as  possible.     V.  CONCLUSIONS     13. The investigation conducted by the ITF established that allegations made by  the Chartered Accountants in their Audit Report 200 2/3 related to the  UNMIK Bank Subject Account were without merit. The ITF investigation  clearly proved that the funds deposited on this Sub ject UNMIK Bank Account  were generated by a legitimate business sanctioned by a valid contract  between UNMIK and the Air BP. None of the deposited  money has been  withdrawn and the only debits to this account were a variety of bank charges.     14. The ITF did not find evidence that would indicate a ny illegalities related to  this UNMIK Bank Account. Staff Member 1 was an “A” signatory to this  Account as well to a number of other UNMIK Bank Acc ounts. Upon his/her  departure from Kosovo, the right of ”A” signatory f or this account (and other  UNMIK Bank Accounts) was formally transferred to ot her authorised  individuals.    15.

INTRODUCTION    1. During an assessment mission to the United Nation s Mission in Liberia (UNMIL),  Investigators of the Investigations Division of the  Office of Internal Oversight Services  (ID/OIOS) received information that Officer 1, form erly with the UNMIL Fuel Cell, was  unable to account for US$500,000 in fuel expenses f or the month of February 2004. At  the time, no further details were provided to ID/OI OS regarding how the complainant  was aware of the fact that the Fuel Cell was unable  to account for the US$500,000, nor in  what way Officer 1 was involved with the matter.    2. As a result of the investigation by ID/OIOS into  the allegation against Officer 1, it  was determined that although it was true that an au dit by Internal Audit Division 1 of  OIOS (IAD1/OIOS) had discovered that, for the perio d 1 August 2003 to 31 March 2004,  290,066 gallons of fuel (valued at US$455,404) coul d not be accounted for by UNMIL,  there was no evidence suggesting that Officer 1 was  personally responsible for the  discrepancy.      II.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION    3. UNMIL was established on 19 September 2003 by Sec urity Council Resolution  1509. Officer 1 was responsible for establishing th e UNMIL Fuel Cell at the start of the  mission, having previously served as an Officer wit h the Mission des Nations Unies au  République Démocratique de Congo (MONUC). During th e time he served as an officer  of the UNMIL Fuel Cell, the unit consisted of himsel f and 20 other staff members (four  International staff and the remainder National staff ). Officer 1 left UNMIL and the  United Nations on 30 June 2004. His replacement, Off icer 2, took over the post on 8 July  2004.    4. In January and February 2004 an audit of “Fuel M anagement in UNMIL”  (Reference AP2004/626/05) was conducted by IAD1/OIO S.      III.   APPLICABLE LEGAL NORMS    Staff Regulation 1.2     (b): “Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of … integrity. The concept of  integrity includes … impartiality, fairness, honest y … in all matters affecting their work  and status.”      2  (q): “Staff members shall use the property and assets o f the Organization only for official  purposes and shall exercise reasonable care when ut ilizing such property and assets”    ST/IC/1996/29     Mismanagement     “(i) Any unreasonable failure of a staff member to perform efficiently, competently and  with the best interests of the Organization in mind , all assigned tasks, duties and  management responsibilities in connection with Unit ed Nations programmes and its  operations”    Waste of resources     “(i) Any unreasonable failure to ensure that the mo netary or other resources of the  Organization are used solely, efficiently and effec tively for the purposes of the  Organization or for its benefit;    (ii) Any unreasonable act or failure to act, which,  as a direct result of a failure to  exercise due care, causes loss to the Organization”       IV.   METHODOLOGY    5. ID/OIOS conducted interviews with all parties co ncerned, other than Officer 1  himself, and reviewed all relevant documentation.      V.   INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS    IAD1/OIOS Audit AP2004/626/05 “Fuel Management in U NMIL”     6.  Prior to travelling to Liberia to investigate t he allegations against Officer 1,  ID/OIOS reviewed the IAD1/OIOS audit report. Amongs t other matters raised in the  report, IAD1/OIOS noted that, for the period 1 Augu st 2003 to 31 March 2004, 290,066  gallons of fuel (valued at US$455,404) could not be  accounted for. The Auditors noted  that there had been an investigation by UNMIL’s Spec ial Investigation Unit (SIU) into  allegations that UNMIL fuel was being sold by bowser  drivers to third parties and that  the investigation had concluded that there was cred ible evidence against some of the  bowser drivers and their supervisor. As a result of  the investigation, the supervisor and  the drivers involved were dismissed. Since the supe rvisor in question was the one  responsible for the monitoring of deliveries and th e completion of bowser log sheets,  IAD1/OIOS concluded that “irregularities in the dis tribution” could account for the  290,066-gallon discrepancy.     3  7. The IAD/OIOS Auditors made a total of 17 recomme ndations to UNMIL  regarding the way that the mission managed fuel. Th e mission accepted all but one of the  recommendations (this recommendation was subsequent ly withdrawn by IAD-1/OIOS)  and has implemented them.    SIU Investigation SIU/MON/0090/04     8. Upon receipt of information on 13 March 2004 tha t UNMIL bowser drivers were  selling UNMIL fuel to local vendors in Monrovia and other parts of Liberia, the SIU  initiated an investigation into the allegations. Th e SIU investigation revealed that some  locally hired drivers, employed to deliver fuel to various UNMIL installations, were  selling a portion of the fuel they were transportin g to local vendors. The SIU found that  the theft and sale of UNMIL fuel was organised by t he drivers’ supervisor and that it had  begun soon after the mission commenced in 2003. As a result of the investigation, the  supervisor and the drivers identified by the SIU we re dismissed. There was no evidence  disclosed during the SIU investigation to suggest t hat Officer 1 was in any way involved  in the theft and subsequent re-sale of the fuel.    ID/OIOS Investigation     9. The original complainant in the case was intervi ewed by ID/OIOS. He stated that  he had no personal knowledge of either the problems  with the Fuel Cell accounts or of  any involvement of Officer 1 in the problems identi fied. He claimed that he had become  aware, as a result of his position in the mission, that an audit was being conducted into  the Fuel Cell accounts and that an amount of approx imately US$500,000 could not be  accounted for. This was the information that he had  communicated to ID/OIOS, along  with the fact that Officer 1 was an Officer of the Fuel Cell at the time. The complainant  was unable to provide any further information to ID /OIOS about the matter under  investigation.    10. The current situation regarding the UNMIL Fuel C ell and fuel management  within UNMIL has been investigated under ID/OIOS Cas e 0430/04 and was not revisited  during this investigation.      VI.  FINDINGS    11. The original complainant, when re-interviewed b y ID/OIOS, was not able to  provide any concrete evidence to suggest that Offic er 1 was in any way responsible for  the US$500,000 discrepancy in the Fuel Cell account s. Indeed, he stated that he had  never mentioned the exact amount involved and that Officer 1’s name had only come up  because Officer 1 was the Officer of the Fuel Cell at the time.    12. Officer 1 is no longer with the United Nations and therefore no longer falls under  the authority of OIOS.     4  13.  The discrepancy mentioned to ID/OIOS by the co mplainant did exist but it had  already been noted by the IAD-1/OIOS Auditors who, in their final report, suggested that  the missing fuel could most probably be attributed to the actions of the former fuel  supervisor and the bowser drivers. These persons we re dismissed from the mission once  their actions became known.    14. UNMIL has acted on the recommendations of the IA D/OIOS Auditors and, as  demonstrated by the results of the investigation in to ID/OIOS Case 0430/04, the situation  regarding fuel management in the mission is much im proved.      VII. CONCLUSIONS    15. The evidence as disclosed during this investiga tion demonstrates that the  allegations against Officer 1 cannot be substantiat ed.      VIII.   RECOMMENDATION    16. In view of the findings of this investigation:    Recommendation 1 : It is recommended that DPKO record this case as u nsubstantiated,  and that Officer 1 is advised that he is cleared of  any wrongdoing as to these allegations.

INTRODUCTION     1. On 13 February 2005, the Investigations Division  of the Office of Internal  Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received a request fro m UNON Official 1 to inquire  into allegations that locally recruited United Nati ons Office at Nairobi (UNON) staff  may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of  appointments showing longer contract duration dates  to obtain loans from the United  Nations Co-operative Savings and Credit Society Lim ited (UN-SACCO), which  operates within UNON premises.       2. The request was prompted by an earlier report su bmitted to UNON  Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff  members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Child ren’s Fund/Somalia Support  Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent  letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary co ncern of UNON Management  was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spr ead to UNON and other Nairobi- based United Nations Agencies.       3. At the time of the request, two ID/OIOS Investig ators were on mission to  Nairobi on another matter, but given the concerns e xpressed by UNON Managers, the  ID/OIOS Investigators were directed by ID/OIOS Mana gement to look into this  matter with celerity, and did so, from 14 through 1 8 February 2005.     4. The purpose of this report is to present the fin dings of the preliminary  ID/OIOS Investigation together with recommendations  for appropriate action by  UNON Management.      II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    A. UN-SACCO    5. According to information provided in a leaflet, (Attachment 1), UN-SACCO  was created in 1975, “to establish a forum for Unit ed Nations staff in Kenya to save  their disposable income and borrow at minimal cost to meet their socio-economic  needs.” At present, UN-SACCO has a capital of US $ 13.5 million with about 2,500  members, and is managed by a Management Committee e lected at an annual General  Meeting of the Society on a renewable three-year te rm.     6. In order to become a UN-SACCO member, a staff me mber of the United  Nations completes an “Application for Membership” f orm (Attachment 2) and pays a  fee of Kshs. 500 (about US $ 7). UN-SACCO members o wn shares and can request  and obtain individual loans after holding membershi p in UN-SACCO for six months.   Members may apply for a loan up to three times the value of their shares.  The length  of the loans cannot extend beyond the term of emplo yment by the United Nations.      2 7. To obtain an individual loan, a staff member is required to complete either a  “Loan Application & Loan Agreement Form” (Attachmen t 3) or an “Instant Loan  Facility Application & Agreement Form” (Attachment 4). The staff member must  attach to his/her request documents including copie s of his/her latest payslip, National  Identification Card or Passport and a copy of his/h er letter of contract.     8. A copy of the letter of contract is required to ensure that the applicant holds a  valid contract, which covers the agreed period of t ime for the repayment of the loan.  The benefit of a longer contract is that it permits  repayment in lesser amounts over a  longer period of time.     9. To ensure guarantee of repayment, the applicant must provide up to six  guarantors in the event of the borrower’s default. The guarantors must also be UN- SACCO members.     10. The applications for loans are reviewed by UN-S ACCO staff and a Credit  Committee, which approve, defer, or reject the appl ication.      B. UNICEF/Somalia Fraud    11. On 10 February 2005, while settling the separat ion payment of a former  locally recruited UNICEF/Somalia staff member, an A dministrative Officer who  worked on the matter noted that the staff member ha d borrowed a large amount of  money from UN-SACCO in January 2004 and that at the  time of his/her separation  s/he still owed UN-SACCO about one-third of the amo unt borrowed.     12. The Administrative Officer learned from UN-SACC O management that the  loan was granted based upon a letter of appointment  submitted to UN-SACCO by that  staff member, which showed that his/her contract wo uld be renewed through 31  December 2006.  However, the contract was actually only from 1 January 2004 to 31  December 2004.    13. The Administrative Officer requested a copy of the appointment letter and  found that it was fraudulent, in that the date of t he expiration of the contract was false  and the signature of a UNICEF Operations Officer na med in the letter was forged.  Upon further inquiries from UN-SACCO managers, UNIC EF/Somalia Management  started an inquiry and found that other UNICEF/Soma lia staff members had obtained  similarly improper loans. UNICEF/Somalia has only a pproximately 20 staff members.    14. The results of this inquiry were described in a  “Report on the preliminary  investigation of a case of fraudulent signatures an d use of office stationary and  official seal – UNICEF Somalia, Nairobi”, dated 11 February 2005, which included  copies of the false letters of appointment and writ ten statements of several locally  recruited UNICEF staff who admitted their improper conduct. (Attachment 5)      III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS    C. Interviews with UNICEF staff    3 15. Upon request from ID/OIOS, UNICEF Management ag reed to cooperate with  the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing access to its file s and staff members involved in the  fraud. However, UNICEF Management insisted, and ID/ OIOS agreed, that ID/OIOS  interviews of their staff be conducted at UNICEF pr emises and in the presence of two  Senior UNICEF Managers. The objectives of these int erviews by ID/OIOS were to  confirm and/or rule out involvement by UNON staff m embers in similar cases and to  obtain information to ensure that UNON management s afeguard mechanisms to avoid  similar occurrences at UNON.     16. ID/OIOS could not interview all UNICEF staff or  former staff involved in the  fraud. For example, one staff member passed away an d another, who had left  UNICEF, declined the interview. In addition, the UN ICEF inquiry was not final and  information obtained primarily through the intervie ws of UNICEF staff by ID/OIOS  suggested that there might be more UNICEF staff inv olved than initially envisaged.        17. During their interviews with ID/OIOS, the conce rned UNICEF staff confirmed  that they misused UNICEF letterhead and official se al, indicated that they forged the  signature of a UNICEF Operations officer and that t hey provided UN-SACCO with  incorrect information about the duration of their c ontracts in order to obtain loans. All  of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed  official UNICEF stamps,  stationeries and computers, although given the limi ted responsibilities of some of  them, for example, the drivers, such access should not have occurred.    18. Further, most interviewees stated that they act ed alone and, with one  exception, all denied that either their UNICEF or U NON colleagues assisted them in  their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise a ware of or involved in such  improper actions.     D. Interviews with UN-SACCO and UNON staff    19. UN-SACCO and UNON staff members interviewed by the ID/OIOS  Investigators provided general information about th eir operations and otherwise  cooperated with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing un hindered access to their files.  However, these interviews did not produce conclusiv e information to either suggest or  completely rule out improper conduct on the part of  UNON staff members.     E. Additional Investigative steps    20. Documentation obtained from UN-SACCO shows that  about 2,500 staff  members from UNON and other United Nations related organizations have requested  and obtained UN-SACCO loans, about one thousand of whom are UNON staff. Given  the large number of records to review, which would then need to be compared to  similar records from UNON, and the absence of any i dentified subjects, the ID/OIOS  Investigators decided to do a thorough review of a sampling of cases.  Files were  selected for review where the loan amount was high,  the duration of the contract long,  or the applicant was also a guarantor on other loan s.     21. Further, whenever the ID/OIOS Investigators not ed apparent irregularities  concerning letters of appointments or other similar  documents produced by these staff  to UN-SACCO, for example letters suggesting that th eir contracts would be renewed  4 beyond the expiration date of their contracts, the ID/OIOS officers made copies of  those documents and compared them with the correspo nding documentation available  in the Official Status Files of those staff and/or confirmed with UNON officials  whose signatures appeared on those letters that the y had indeed signed them.    22. The ID/OIOS Investigators noted with concern th at in January 2005, one  Senior UNEP Manager had informed UN-SACCO managemen t that the contract of a  particular staff member is likely to be extended fo r a further two years, subject to  satisfactory performance. During the manager’s inte rview with ID/OIOS, s/he  admitted s/he had written a letter at the request o f the staff member and advised that  such letters are sometimes provided to UN-SACCO so that locally recruited staff can  obtain loans.  ID/OIOS cautions managers that the i ssuance of these letters may give  the impression that a staff member’s contract will be renewed.    23. In this regard, it should be noted that most, i f not all letters of appointments  issued by the Organization, provide that fixed-term  appointments do not carry any  expectation of renewal or of conversion to any othe r type of appointment and expire  automatically and without prior notice on the expir ation date specified in the letter of  appointment.    24. This position is consistent with the jurisprude nce of the United Nations  Administrative Tribunal (UNAT), which has establish ed that good performance by a  staff member does not by itself create any legitima te expectation for renewal of any  fixed-term contract (see Judgement 562 dated 2 July  1993).       IV. FINDINGS    25. Given the absence of concrete information conce rning improper conduct by  UNON staff, and based upon the review of a limited number of UN-SACCO and  UNON files, ID/OIOS finds that, while there is evid ence of improper conduct on the  part of some UNICEF staff members in obtaining loan s from UN-SACCO, there is no  evidence that such similar improper conduct also oc curred at UNON.       26. In fact, as noted above, rather than producing information about possible  involvement of UNON staff in a similar fraud, the i nterviews of UNICEF/Somalia  staff yielded more information about further possib le UNICEF subjects involved in  the same type of fraud, who had either not been ide ntified in the UNICEF preliminary  inquiry or had not been interviewed. Moreover, thes e interviews also suggested  possible improper conduct by one UNICEF manager, wh o may have contributed to  the fraud by providing a letter, which suggested th at the contract of one staff would be  extended further beyond its normal term.       5 27. The review of likely candidates for such frauds  ( i.e., those with large loans and  long contracts) did not produce a single instance o f fraud.  However, ID/OIOS cannot  exclude the possibility that locally recruited UNON  staff members have submitted  fraudulent letters to UN-SACCO to obtain loans, as had their UNICEF colleagues.  Without concrete leads or a thorough review of all of the numerous files of the UNON  staff members who have obtained UN-SACCO loans, it is not possible to rule out  similar fraudulent schemes undertaken by UNON staff .     28. ID/OIOS noted with concern the ease with which locally recruited UNICEF  staff, such as drivers, obtained access to official  UNICEF stamps, stationeries and  computers. UNON should ensure that there are adequa te controls in place to prevent  such abuses in UNON.     29. Further, while analysing the fraudulent scheme at UNICEF/Somalia, ID/OIOS  noted that when requests for letters of appointment  suggesting contract renewal were  denied, staff members produced fraudulent letters o f appointment which were  accepted by UN-SACCO management, although they were  clearly different in style  and format from legitimate letters.     30. Furthermore, as noted above, in one case detect ed by ID/OIOS a letter of  appointment, which stated that renewal for two year s was subject to satisfactory  performance, was provided to a UNON staff member.  Such a letter, even from one  with the authority to do so, is improper, may be us ed to demonstrate a staff member’s  “right” to a renewal, and should stop immediately.         V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS    31. In light of the foregoing, ID/OIOS offers the f ollowing recommendations,  which could reduce the risk of the occurrences of s imilar fraudulent activities as the  one described in this report:     Recommendation 1 : It is recommended that UNON Management inform UN- SACCO Management that henceforth they should requir e original official UNON  documentation from UNON staff members, and any susp icions about the veracity of  such documentation should be promptly reported to U NON and the authenticity of  those documents verified. (ID Rec. No. IV05/050/01)           Recommendation 2:  It is recommended that UNON ascertain if its perso nnel officers  are aware of instances of staff members requesting letters or documentation averring  that their contracts would be renewed beyond their expiration dates, and such requests  were denied.  If so, UNON Management should liaise with UN-SACCO Management    to determine whether such staff members then submit ted fraudulent documentation to  obtain loans. (ID Rec. No. IV05/050/02)    Recommendation 3 : It is recommended that UNON Management ensure tha t its  official UNON seals/stamps are placed in secured pl aces and are used solely by  authorized UNON officials to prevent the risk of th eir misuse by other persons. (ID  Rec. IV05/050/03)    6 Recommendation 4 : It is recommended that UNON Management requests U N- SACCO Management to systematically confirm with UNO N Personnel offices any  information related to employment duration provided  to them by UNON staff  members.

INTRODUCTION 1. On 13 February 2005, the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received a request fro m UNON Official 1 to inquire into allegations that locally recruited United Nati ons Office at Nairobi (UNON) staff may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments showing longer contract duration dates to obtain loans from the United Nations Co-operative Savings and Credit Society Lim ited (UN-SACCO), which operates within UNON premises. 2. The request was prompted by an earlier report su bmitted to UNON Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Child ren’s Fund/Somalia Support Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary co ncern of UNON Management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spr ead to UNON and other Nairobi- based United Nations Agencies. 3. At the time of the request, two ID/OIOS Investig ators were on mission to Nairobi on another matter, but given the concerns e xpressed by UNON Managers, the ID/OIOS Investigators were directed by ID/OIOS Mana gement to look into this matter with celerity, and did so, from 14 through 1 8 February 2005. 4. The purpose of this report is to present the fin dings of the preliminary ID/OIOS Investigation together with recommendations for appropriate action by UNON Management. II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION A. UN-SACCO 5. According to information provided in a leaflet, (Attachment 1), UN-SACCO was created in 1975, “to establish a forum for Unit ed Nations staff in Kenya to save their disposable income and borrow at minimal cost to meet their socio-economic needs.” At present, UN-SACCO has a capital of US $ 13.5 million with about 2,500 members, and is managed by a Management Committee e lected at an annual General Meeting of the Society on a renewable three-year te rm. 6. In order to become a UN-SACCO member, a staff me mber of the United Nations completes an “Application for Membership” f orm (Attachment 2) and pays a fee of Kshs. 500 (about US $ 7). UN-SACCO members o wn shares and can request and obtain individual loans after holding membershi p in UN-SACCO for six months. Members may apply for a loan up to three times the value of their shares. The length of the loans cannot extend beyond the term of emplo yment by the United Nations. 2 7. To obtain an individual loan, a staff member is required to complete either a “Loan Application & Loan Agreement Form” (Attachmen t 3) or an “Instant Loan Facility Application & Agreement Form” (Attachment 4). The staff member must attach to his/her request documents including copie s of his/her latest payslip, National Identification Card or Passport and a copy of his/h er letter of contract. 8. A copy of the letter of contract is required to ensure that the applicant holds a valid contract, which covers the agreed period of t ime for the repayment of the loan. The benefit of a longer contract is that it permits repayment in lesser amounts over a longer period of time. 9. To ensure guarantee of repayment, the applicant must provide up to six guarantors in the event of the borrower’s default. The guarantors must also be UN- SACCO members. 10. The applications for loans are reviewed by UN-S ACCO staff and a Credit Committee, which approve, defer, or reject the appl ication. B. UNICEF/Somalia Fraud 11. On 10 February 2005, while settling the separat ion payment of a former locally recruited UNICEF/Somalia staff member, an A dministrative Officer who worked on the matter noted that the staff member ha d borrowed a large amount of money from UN-SACCO in January 2004 and that at the time of his/her separation s/he still owed UN-SACCO about one-third of the amo unt borrowed. 12. The Administrative Officer learned from UN-SACC O management that the loan was granted based upon a letter of appointment submitted to UN-SACCO by that staff member, which showed that his/her contract wo uld be renewed through 31 December 2006. However, the contract was actually only from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004. 13. The Administrative Officer requested a copy of the appointment letter and found that it was fraudulent, in that the date of t he expiration of the contract was false and the signature of a UNICEF Operations Officer na med in the letter was forged. Upon further inquiries from UN-SACCO managers, UNIC EF/Somalia Management started an inquiry and found that other UNICEF/Soma lia staff members had obtained similarly improper loans. UNICEF/Somalia has only a pproximately 20 staff members. 14. The results of this inquiry were described in a “Report on the preliminary investigation of a case of fraudulent signatures an d use of office stationary and official seal – UNICEF Somalia, Nairobi”, dated 11 February 2005, which included copies of the false letters of appointment and writ ten statements of several locally recruited UNICEF staff who admitted their improper conduct. (Attachment 5) III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS C. Interviews with UNICEF staff 3 15. Upon request from ID/OIOS, UNICEF Management ag reed to cooperate with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing access to its file s and staff members involved in the fraud. However, UNICEF Management insisted, and ID/ OIOS agreed, that ID/OIOS interviews of their staff be conducted at UNICEF pr emises and in the presence of two Senior UNICEF Managers. The objectives of these int erviews by ID/OIOS were to confirm and/or rule out involvement by UNON staff m embers in similar cases and to obtain information to ensure that UNON management s afeguard mechanisms to avoid similar occurrences at UNON. 16. ID/OIOS could not interview all UNICEF staff or former staff involved in the fraud. For example, one staff member passed away an d another, who had left UNICEF, declined the interview. In addition, the UN ICEF inquiry was not final and information obtained primarily through the intervie ws of UNICEF staff by ID/OIOS suggested that there might be more UNICEF staff inv olved than initially envisaged. 17. During their interviews with ID/OIOS, the conce rned UNICEF staff confirmed that they misused UNICEF letterhead and official se al, indicated that they forged the signature of a UNICEF Operations officer and that t hey provided UN-SACCO with incorrect information about the duration of their c ontracts in order to obtain loans. All of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and computers, although given the limi ted responsibilities of some of them, for example, the drivers, such access should not have occurred. 18. Further, most interviewees stated that they act ed alone and, with one exception, all denied that either their UNICEF or U NON colleagues assisted them in their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise a ware of or involved in such improper actions. D. Interviews with UN-SACCO and UNON staff 19. UN-SACCO and UNON staff members interviewed by the ID/OIOS Investigators provided general information about th eir operations and otherwise cooperated with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing un hindered access to their files. However, these interviews did not produce conclusiv e information to either suggest or completely rule out improper conduct on the part of UNON staff members. E. Additional Investigative steps 20. Documentation obtained from UN-SACCO shows that about 2,500 staff members from UNON and other United Nations related organizations have requested and obtained UN-SACCO loans, about one thousand of whom are UNON staff. Given the large number of records to review, which would then need to be compared to similar records from UNON, and the absence of any i dentified subjects, the ID/OIOS Investigators decided to do a thorough review of a sampling of cases. Files were selected for review where the loan amount was high, the duration of the contract long, or the applicant was also a guarantor on other loan s. 21. Further, whenever the ID/OIOS Investigators not ed apparent irregularities concerning letters of appointments or other similar documents produced by these staff to UN-SACCO, for example letters suggesting that th eir contracts would be renewed 4 beyond the expiration date of their contracts, the ID/OIOS officers made copies of those documents and compared them with the correspo nding documentation available in the Official Status Files of those staff and/or confirmed with UNON officials whose signatures appeared on those letters that the y had indeed signed them. 22. The ID/OIOS Investigators noted with concern th at in January 2005, one Senior UNEP Manager had informed UN-SACCO managemen t that the contract of a particular staff member is likely to be extended fo r a further two years, subject to satisfactory performance. During the manager’s inte rview with ID/OIOS, s/he admitted s/he had written a letter at the request o f the staff member and advised that such letters are sometimes provided to UN-SACCO so that locally recruited staff can obtain loans. ID/OIOS cautions managers that the i ssuance of these letters may give the impression that a staff member’s contract will be renewed. 23. In this regard, it should be noted that most, i f not all letters of appointments issued by the Organization, provide that fixed-term appointments do not carry any expectation of renewal or of conversion to any othe r type of appointment and expire automatically and without prior notice on the expir ation date specified in the letter of appointment. 24. This position is consistent with the jurisprude nce of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal (UNAT), which has establish ed that good performance by a staff member does not by itself create any legitima te expectation for renewal of any fixed-term contract (see Judgement 562 dated 2 July 1993). IV. FINDINGS 25. Given the absence of concrete information conce rning improper conduct by UNON staff, and based upon the review of a limited number of UN-SACCO and UNON files, ID/OIOS finds that, while there is evid ence of improper conduct on the part of some UNICEF staff members in obtaining loan s from UN-SACCO, there is no evidence that such similar improper conduct also oc curred at UNON. 26. In fact, as noted above, rather than producing information about possible involvement of UNON staff in a similar fraud, the i nterviews of UNICEF/Somalia staff yielded more information about further possib le UNICEF subjects involved in the same type of fraud, who had either not been ide ntified in the UNICEF preliminary inquiry or had not been interviewed. Moreover, thes e interviews also suggested possible improper conduct by one UNICEF manager, wh o may have contributed to the fraud by providing a letter, which suggested th at the contract of one staff would be extended further beyond its normal term. 5 27. The review of likely candidates for such frauds ( i.e., those with large loans and long contracts) did not produce a single instance o f fraud. However, ID/OIOS cannot exclude the possibility that locally recruited UNON staff members have submitted fraudulent letters to UN-SACCO to obtain loans, as had their UNICEF colleagues. Without concrete leads or a thorough review of all of the numerous files of the UNON staff members who have obtained UN-SACCO loans, it is not possible to rule out similar fraudulent schemes undertaken by UNON staff . 28. ID/OIOS noted with concern the ease with which locally recruited UNICEF staff, such as drivers, obtained access to official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and computers. UNON should ensure that there are adequa te controls in place to prevent such abuses in UNON. 29.

Furthermore, as noted above, in one case detect ed by ID/OIOS a letter of appointment, which stated that renewal for two year s was subject to satisfactory performance, was provided to a UNON staff member.

(ID/OIOS Case No. 0575/03)      I.  INTRODUCTION     1. In October 2003, the Investigations Division of Office of Internal Oversight Services  (ID/OIOS) received information that in May 2003 UNON/ ITS Staff Member, a staff member in  the Information Technology Service of the United Nat ions Office in Nairobi (UNON/ITS),  solicited and obtained Ksh 22,250 (US$294.70) with the promise to extend a New York tie-line  satellite connection from the United Nations Politic al Office for Somalia (UNPOS) to the  residence of the Representative of the Secretary Ge neral. Given the low priority of this case, it  was investigated when time and resources permitted.  The investigation is now complete.       II.  APPLICABLE LAW     Staff Regulation 1.2        (b) Staff members shall uphold the highest standar ds of efficiency, competence  and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, b ut is not limited to, probity,  impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in  all matters affecting their work  and status…     Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Natio ns, ST/SGB/2003/7 of 9 May 2003    A.  Rule 101.2 “All United Nations staff are obligated to comply w ith the  Financial Regulations and Rules and with administra tive instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any st aff member who contravenes  the Financial Regulations and Rules or correspondin g administrative instructions  may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions.”         C. Regulation 5.12: Procurement functions include all the actions neces sary  for the acquisition, by purchase or lease, of prope rty, including, all products and  real property, and of services, including works. Th e following general principles  shall be given due consideration when exercising th e procurement functions of the  United Nations:    a) Best value for money;  b)  Fairness, integrity and transparency;  c)  Effective international competition;  d) The interests of the United Nations.              III.  METHODOLOGY     3.  ID/OIOS reviewed documents relevant to the inve stigation and researched pertinent  United Nations rules and regulations as well as loca l laws. ID/OIOS also interviewed witnesses  in UNON, UNPOS and UNDP offices in Nairobi.       IV.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4.  UNPOS is a mission set up by the Department of P olitical Affairs (DPA) and is headed  by a Representative of the Secretary General (RSG).  UNPOS is based at the UNON compound  in Gigiri, Kenya and receives common services suppo rt from UNON.       V. INVESTGATIVE DETAILS    5. ID/OIOS interviewed various members of the UNPOS sta ff who provided the following  information.  The UNPOS Official wished to extend th e New York tie-line satellite connection  from the RSG office to the RSG residence.  His/her staff located the UNON/ITS Staff Member  who  said s/he could provide the connection with the pur chase of a few items of equipment.  UNPOS  requested, on 15 May 2003, that a cheque for Kshs 2 2,250 be issued to the UNON/ITS Staff  Member for this purpose, which s/he cashed.  Howeve r, s/he never provided the service, nor did  s/he return the money when asked.  On 27 August 200 3 the UNPOS Official’s administrative  assistant made a formal request to the UNON Official for the installation and on 7 October 2003  a letter from UNPOS signed by the UNPOS Official to t he UNON Official alleged that the  UNON/ITS Staff Member had promised this service, rec eived payment but had not provided the  service or returned the money.    6. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON/ITS Staff Member, who c laimed that his/her verbal  proposal to UNPOS was that s/he would prepare the eq uipment for the satellite link, but that  installation was to be carried out by a licensed co mpany.  S/he said that the payment to him/her  was only for preparation of the equipment.  S/he ex plained that his/her advice that the satellite  connection was possible was based on his/her projec ted use of required equipment that was lying  unused in the UNON workshop.  However, s/he did not g et approval for the use of this  equipment at the time of his/her proposal from his/ her supervisor, the UNON Official, who was  on leave.  When s/he did speak to the UNON Official, s/he was told that the equipment could not  be used by UNPOS and that UNPOS should initiate a pr ocurement procedure for the job or  arrange to purchase and install the equipment itsel f.  The UNON/ITS Staff Member gave this  information to the UNPOS Official’s administrative a ssistant.  S/he told ID/OIOS that s/he was  willing to refund the money, but had not done so.     7. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON Official.  S/he stated that upon receipt of the formal  request for installation of the satellite link, s/h e informed UNPOS that the equipment required  would cost $11,560.  S/he told ID/OIOS that the pro per procedure to obtain this link required  UNPOS to make a formal request to his/her office an d, after its approval, a procurement process  would take place.  Due to limitations of staff and a lack of licensing authority, UNON/IT could   play an advisory role, but the company that won the  bid would provide equipment and  installation.      8. The UNON Official also told ID/OIOS said s/he had not  known of the UNON/ITS Staff  Member’s initiative until after s/he received UNPOS’  formal request for the satellite link. After  receipt of the UNPOS Official’s letter of 7 October 2003, s/he referred the matter to the UNON  Security and Safety Unit for investigation.        VI. FINDINGS    9. UNPOS attempted to achieve an extension of the satel lite link from its office to the  residence of the RSG.  A verbal arrangement was mad e with the UNON/ITS Staff Member and  payment arranged for him/her of Ksh 22,250.      10. While the UNON/ITS Staff Member claimed that s/he to ld UNPOS that s/he was using  the money to purchase equipment to repair a power s upply for the project and that installation  would have to be carried out by a licensed company,  UNPOS’ claim that the agreement was that  the UNON/ITS Staff Member was to handle the entire pr oject for this sum is supported by the  evidence.      11. The UNON/ITS Staff Member had intended to use expens ive equipment from the UNON  workshop, but did not receive permission to do so f rom his/her supervisor prior to his/her  arrangement with UNPOS.  When the UNON Official learne d of these arrangements, s/he told  the UNON/ITS Staff Member the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that a request for  extension of the satellite link must go though the proper channels.    12. UNPOS did not receive an extension of its satellite link to the residence and the  UNON/ITS Staff Member did not return the money paid him/her.      VII. CONCLUSION    13. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite l ink to the RSG residence, receiving  money for said undertaking, failing to provide the satellite link and refusing to return the money  paid to him/her, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted con trary to his/her obligations under Staff  Regulation 1.2    14. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite l ink to the RSG residence, the  UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obli gations under The Financial Regulations  and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2003/7, Regul ation 5.12.

(ID/OIOS Case No. 0575/03) I. INTRODUCTION 1. In October 2003, the Investigations Division of Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received information that in May 2003 UNON/ ITS Staff Member, a staff member in the Information Technology Service of the United Nat ions Office in Nairobi (UNON/ITS), solicited and obtained Ksh 22,250 (US$294.70) with the promise to extend a New York tie-line satellite connection from the United Nations Politic al Office for Somalia (UNPOS) to the residence of the Representative of the Secretary Ge neral. Given the low priority of this case, it was investigated when time and resources permitted. The investigation is now complete. II. APPLICABLE LAW Staff Regulation 1.2 (b) Staff members shall uphold the highest standar ds of efficiency, competence and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, b ut is not limited to, probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status… Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Natio ns, ST/SGB/2003/7 of 9 May 2003 A.

Regulation 5.12: Procurement functions include all the actions neces sary for the acquisition, by purchase or lease, of prope rty, including, all products and real property, and of services, including works. Th e following general principles shall be given due consideration when exercising th e procurement functions of the United Nations: a) Best value for money; b) Fairness, integrity and transparency; c) Effective international competition; d) The interests of the United Nations. III. METHODOLOGY 3. ID/OIOS reviewed documents relevant to the inve stigation and researched pertinent United Nations rules and regulations as well as loca l laws. ID/OIOS also interviewed witnesses in UNON, UNPOS and UNDP offices in Nairobi. IV. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 4. UNPOS is a mission set up by the Department of P olitical Affairs (DPA) and is headed by a Representative of the Secretary General (RSG). UNPOS is based at the UNON compound in Gigiri, Kenya and receives common services suppo rt from UNON. V. INVESTGATIVE DETAILS 5. ID/OIOS interviewed various members of the UNPOS sta ff who provided the following information. The UNPOS Official wished to extend th e New York tie-line satellite connection from the RSG office to the RSG residence. His/her staff located the UNON/ITS Staff Member who said s/he could provide the connection with the pur chase of a few items of equipment. UNPOS requested, on 15 May 2003, that a cheque for Kshs 2 2,250 be issued to the UNON/ITS Staff Member for this purpose, which s/he cashed. Howeve r, s/he never provided the service, nor did s/he return the money when asked. On 27 August 200 3 the UNPOS Official’s administrative assistant made a formal request to the UNON Official for the installation and on 7 October 2003 a letter from UNPOS signed by the UNPOS Official to t he UNON Official alleged that the UNON/ITS Staff Member had promised this service, rec eived payment but had not provided the service or returned the money. 6. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON/ITS Staff Member, who c laimed that his/her verbal proposal to UNPOS was that s/he would prepare the eq uipment for the satellite link, but that installation was to be carried out by a licensed co mpany. S/he said that the payment to him/her was only for preparation of the equipment. S/he ex plained that his/her advice that the satellite connection was possible was based on his/her projec ted use of required equipment that was lying unused in the UNON workshop. However, s/he did not g et approval for the use of this equipment at the time of his/her proposal from his/ her supervisor, the UNON Official, who was on leave. When s/he did speak to the UNON Official, s/he was told that the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that UNPOS should initiate a pr ocurement procedure for the job or arrange to purchase and install the equipment itsel f. The UNON/ITS Staff Member gave this information to the UNPOS Official’s administrative a ssistant. S/he told ID/OIOS that s/he was willing to refund the money, but had not done so. 7. ID/OIOS interviewed the UNON Official. S/he stated that upon receipt of the formal request for installation of the satellite link, s/h e informed UNPOS that the equipment required would cost $11,560. S/he told ID/OIOS that the pro per procedure to obtain this link required UNPOS to make a formal request to his/her office an d, after its approval, a procurement process would take place. Due to limitations of staff and a lack of licensing authority, UNON/IT could play an advisory role, but the company that won the bid would provide equipment and installation. 8. The UNON Official also told ID/OIOS said s/he had not known of the UNON/ITS Staff Member’s initiative until after s/he received UNPOS’ formal request for the satellite link. After receipt of the UNPOS Official’s letter of 7 October 2003, s/he referred the matter to the UNON Security and Safety Unit for investigation. VI. FINDINGS 9. UNPOS attempted to achieve an extension of the satel lite link from its office to the residence of the RSG. A verbal arrangement was mad e with the UNON/ITS Staff Member and payment arranged for him/her of Ksh 22,250. 10. While the UNON/ITS Staff Member claimed that s/he to ld UNPOS that s/he was using the money to purchase equipment to repair a power s upply for the project and that installation would have to be carried out by a licensed company, UNPOS’ claim that the agreement was that the UNON/ITS Staff Member was to handle the entire pr oject for this sum is supported by the evidence. 11. The UNON/ITS Staff Member had intended to use expens ive equipment from the UNON workshop, but did not receive permission to do so f rom his/her supervisor prior to his/her arrangement with UNPOS. When the UNON Official learne d of these arrangements, s/he told the UNON/ITS Staff Member the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that a request for extension of the satellite link must go though the proper channels. 12. UNPOS did not receive an extension of its satellite link to the residence and the UNON/ITS Staff Member did not return the money paid him/her. VII. CONCLUSION 13. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite l ink to the RSG residence, receiving money for said undertaking, failing to provide the satellite link and refusing to return the money paid to him/her, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted con trary to his/her obligations under Staff Regulation 1.2 14. By personally undertaking to extend the satellite l ink to the RSG residence, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obli gations under The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2003/7, Regul ation 5.12.

(Case 0280/04 )      I. INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants which led to an investigation concernin g alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. There are two specific allegations in this repor t of investigation:   • no proper description of the cabins for the cleani ng machines was included by  companies submitting bids in the first tender;  • tender specifications for both tenders the cleanin g machines were taken from the  brochure of one of the companies submitting a tende r, thereby giving it an unfair  advantage in the tender process.      II. APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS AND UNITED NATIONS  PROCEDURAL RULES    Section 1 of UNMIK Regulation 1999/24  dated 12 December 1999 as amended,  states that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:  a) “The regulations promulgated by the Special Repr esentative of the  Secretary-General (SRSG) and subsidiary instruments  issued pursuant to  those regulations; and   b) The Law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.”    UN Staff Regulations 1.2 (b)  stipulates “Staff members shall uphold the highest   standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”    UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds  provides that:  Article 4 1  – “Competition among and participation in the proc urement process  shall be maximised.”  Article 4.1.1  – “All Suppliers and Contractors and their tenders  shall be treated  fairly, equally, and non-discriminatorily, without favouritism or prejudice and each  Tender shall be judged on its merits.”  Article 4.3.3 . – “If a consultant or any principal, officer or e mployee of such  consultant has participated or will participate in any manner in the preparation of  2  the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s Tendering  for a contract, including  but not limited to preparations of specifications o r any other Tender Documents,     no such consultant nor any principal officer or emp loyee of such consultant, no  “related person” nor any “illegal payer” may tender  for or sponsor or participate in  the Tendering for such contract.”  Article 15 1 – “ Technical specifications and descriptions of the Go ods, Works, or  Services to be procured shall be carefully prepared  to foster fair and open  competition among all suppliers.”  Article 15.4 – “ There shall be no requirements or reference in the technical  specifications to a particular trademark, brand nam e, patent, design, type, origin,  producer or service provider unless (a) there is no  sufficiently precise or  intelligible way of describing the procurement requ irements and (b) qualifying  words, such as “or equivalent” are included in such  requirement or reference.”    Staff Rule 110.1: Misconduct . “Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her  obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and the  Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuan ces, or to observe the standards of  conduct expected of an international civil servant,  may amount to unsatisfactory  conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of  disciplinary measures for misconduct.”      I. METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.      II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina  Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK,  including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport  and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport  Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs.  DOTI Official 1 left  UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an  3  international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations,  reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this  role until 30 September 2001.  Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the  armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer 1,  Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later  by the Consultant from the  Consulting Firm.    6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The Divisional  Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under him  were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.    7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.      III. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     9. This part of the investigation relates to two te nders for a contract, for the supply  of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value  of the contract was  €180,816.00.    Allegation 1  (It is alleged that the first tender was irregularl y cancelled due to the fact that no  proper description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines was included by  companies submitting bids in the first tender)    10. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procure ment Officer, dated 18 April  2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evalua tion process to select a  company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Air port on 18 April 2003.  However, a notification letter from the PEAP Offici al and the KTA Divisional  Manager to the companies participating in the tende r exercise dated 6 June 2003  confirms that this tender was cancelled.    11. When asked about the reason for the cancellatio n, the Procurement Officer 1  stated to the ITF that the technical specifications  for the first tender were taken  from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offer ed those machines, as a result  of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was  of the most expensive type. (See below allegation 2 )    12. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Eval uation Committee, when asked  the same question, stated that the first tender was  cancelled due to the fact that  the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the  cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submit ted. However, he/she added  that from his/her knowledge at least two of the com panies had included a proper  description of the cabins in their bid documents.    4  13. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the I TF that the Airport requested  cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleanin g could be carried out in  different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in  their bids. He/she did not indicate that two bidder s included a proper description  in their bid documents.    14. In the light of the evidence provided, and deta iled below, the ITF does not find  that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due  to the fact that no proper  description of the cabins for the cleaning machines  was included by companies  submitting bids in the first tender.    Allegation 2     First tender    (It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were  taken from the brochure of one of the companies sub mitting a tender, thereby giving  it an unfair advantage in the tender process)    15. The person responsible for drawing up the speci fications for the both tenders was  the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed  in interview that he/she had  been asked to draw up the specifications by the Mem ber of the Evaluation  Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of  the Evaluation Committee  provided him with signed photocopies from the broch ure of Vendor 1 in order to  assist him in drawing up the specifications. The En gineer at the Pristina Airport  added that he/she used them as a basis for the tech nical specifications. The ITF  located a draft of an undated handwritten note from  the Engineer at the Pristina  Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confir ms that he/she used the  photocopies from the brochure to assist him in draw ing up the technical  specifications for the cleaning machines. The Membe r of the Evaluation  Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed t he signed pages to the  Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the p reparation of the technical  specifications for the cleaning machines.     16. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Me mber of the Evaluation Committee  were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of  Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, an d in particular Articles 15.1 and  15.4.  The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicat ed that he/she worked on the  general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the  Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be  ignorant of Article 15  altogether.     Second tender    17. A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indi cates that a second tender  exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one.     18. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the s econd tender indicated that  although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender , Procurement Officer 2 did  the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluatio n Committee. This is  confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official  5  dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an  ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to  Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluati on committee in his/her  interview.      19. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation  committee chose Vendor 2.  However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for  signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport man agement, although he/she did  not state by whom, to put it on hold until the tech nical evaluation committee and  airport management had organised a meeting with the  Procurement Officer 1.    20. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to  concerns that the winning bid was the second most e xpensive and doubts that  the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company.    21. An examination of the technical evaluation repo rt and Vendor 2’s bid  documentation suggests that the specification produ ced by Vendor 2 was very  similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was  provided with the technical specifications in advan ce. In addition, Vendor 1, the  company from whose brochure the specifications were  taken, did not submit a  bid.     22. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the se cond largest producer of industrial  cleaning machines in one United Nations member stat e being founded in 1966. It  went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a mu lti-national company. An  Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2.  There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connec ted to the multi-national  company.    23. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interv iew with the ITF, also stated that the  evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whethe r it would be worthwhile  purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meet ing the specification criteria,  came at a high price.        IV. FINDINGS OF FACT    24. The first tender for cleaning machines was canc elled due to alleged deficiencies  in the description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines in the bids submitted  and the fact that a brochure from the Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the  technical specifications for the cleaning machines.  This gave rise to concerns that  the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company,  namely Vendor 1.    25. The second tender was not awarded due to concer ns that the technical  specifications produced from the brochure of Vendor  1 had given an unfair  advantage to one company; and doubts as to the high  purchase cost of the  cleaning machines which met the specification crite ria.    6    V. CONCLUSIONS    26. On the available information, the decision lead ing to the cancellation of the first  tender was correct, since concerns had been raised concerning both the  descriptions of the machines to be purchased and th e fact that a brochure from  Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technic al specifications for the  cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications  had given an unfair advantage to one company in bre ach of Article 15.1 of     UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using  Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.      27. The reasons for the second tender not proceedin g appear to be well founded if  concerns were expressed over the offer price and th e technical specification.  However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate  whether in this instance, the  use of technical specifications from a particular c ompany brochure was a  deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or  due to ignorance of the  regulations.      VI. RECOMMENDATION    28.  Based on the above information, the ITF recomm ends that UNMIK refer this  report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deeme d appropriate with regard to  ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders d o not utilise technical  specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the  course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01) .","UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK NATIONS UNIES Mission d’Administration Intérimaire des Nations Unies au Kosovo Investigation Task Force Investigation into allegations of irregularities in two tender processes for the supply of cleaning machines to Pristina Airport.

UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport. 5. Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for t he administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration P illar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supe rvised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure A ffairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an 3 international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charg e of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of e ngineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, spec ifically Airport Engineer 1, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3 and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm. 6. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1. 7. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations. 8. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined. III. INVESTIGATION DETAILS 9. This part of the investigation relates to two te nders for a contract, for the supply of cleaning machines at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was €180,816.00. Allegation 1 (It is alleged that the first tender was irregularl y cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender) 10. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procure ment Officer, dated 18 April 2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evalua tion process to select a company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Air port on 18 April 2003. However, a notification letter from the PEAP Offici al and the KTA Divisional Manager to the companies participating in the tende r exercise dated 6 June 2003 confirms that this tender was cancelled. 11. When asked about the reason for the cancellatio n, the Procurement Officer 1 stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offer ed those machines, as a result of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was of the most expensive type. (See below allegation 2 ) 12. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Eval uation Committee, when asked the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submit ted. However, he/she added that from his/her knowledge at least two of the com panies had included a proper description of the cabins in their bid documents. 4 13. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the I TF that the Airport requested cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleanin g could be carried out in different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in their bids. He/she did not indicate that two bidder s included a proper description in their bid documents. 14. In the light of the evidence provided, and deta iled below, the ITF does not find that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender. Allegation 2 First tender (It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the brochure of one of the companies sub mitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the tender process) 15. The person responsible for drawing up the speci fications for the both tenders was the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had been asked to draw up the specifications by the Mem ber of the Evaluation Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee provided him with signed photocopies from the broch ure of Vendor 1 in order to assist him in drawing up the specifications. The En gineer at the Pristina Airport added that he/she used them as a basis for the tech nical specifications. The ITF located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confir ms that he/she used the photocopies from the brochure to assist him in draw ing up the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Membe r of the Evaluation Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed t he signed pages to the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the p reparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. 16. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Me mber of the Evaluation Committee were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, an d in particular Articles 15.1 and 15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicat ed that he/she worked on the general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15 altogether. Second tender 17. A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indi cates that a second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one. 18. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the s econd tender indicated that although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender , Procurement Officer 2 did the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluatio n Committee. This is confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official 5 dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluati on committee in his/her interview. 19. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2. However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport man agement, although he/she did not state by whom, to put it on hold until the tech nical evaluation committee and airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1. 20. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most e xpensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company. 21. An examination of the technical evaluation repo rt and Vendor 2’s bid documentation suggests that the specification produ ced by Vendor 2 was very similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was provided with the technical specifications in advan ce. In addition, Vendor 1, the company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a bid. 22. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the se cond largest producer of industrial cleaning machines in one United Nations member stat e being founded in 1966. It went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a mu lti-national company. An Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2. There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connec ted to the multi-national company. 23. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interv iew with the ITF, also stated that the evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whethe r it would be worthwhile purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meet ing the specification criteria, came at a high price. IV. FINDINGS OF FACT 24. The first tender for cleaning machines was canc elled due to alleged deficiencies in the description of the cabins for the cleaning m achines in the bids submitted and the fact that a brochure from the Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications had given an unfair ad vantage to one company, namely Vendor 1. 25. The second tender was not awarded due to concer ns that the technical specifications produced from the brochure of Vendor 1 had given an unfair advantage to one company; and doubts as to the high purchase cost of the cleaning machines which met the specification crite ria. 6 V. CONCLUSIONS 26. On the available information, the decision lead ing to the cancellation of the first tender was correct, since concerns had been raised concerning both the descriptions of the machines to be purchased and th e fact that a brochure from Vendor 1 was used in the preparation of the technic al specifications for the cleaning machines. This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company in bre ach of Article 15.1 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds. 27. The reasons for the second tender not proceedin g appear to be well founded if concerns were expressed over the offer price and th e technical specification. However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether in this instance, the use of technical specifications from a particular c ompany brochure was a deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or due to ignorance of the regulations. VI. RECOMMENDATION 28. Based on the above information, the ITF recomm ends that UNMIK refer this report to the D/SRSG Pillar IV for any action deeme d appropriate with regard to ensuring that staff involved in preparing tenders d o not utilise technical specifications that would give an unfair advantage to individual companies in the course of subsequent tender exercises (IV04/280/01) .",Kosovo; Pristina Airport; Pristina International Airport; the Pristina Airport,DOTI; Ko; Mem; Membe; Pristina; Repr; bre ach; concer ns,Airport; Airport Engineer 1; Civil Administration P; DOTI Official 1; Divisional; ICAO; ITF; KFOR; KTA; Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds; Pristina Air; Pristina Airport Procurement; Procure; Procurement; Public Procurement; Tender Documents; UN; UNITED NATIONS PROCEDURAL RULES Section 1; UNITED NATIONS United Nations Interim Administration Mission; UNMIK; UNMIK Finance Administrative; United Nations; United Nations Sec; advan ce; the Air Traffic Control Services; the Airport Sector; the Chartered Accountants; the Consulting Firm; the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI; the Eval uation Committee; the Evaluatio n Committee; the Evaluation Committee; the Investigation Task Force; the Kosovo Force; the Kosovo Trust Agency; the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina; the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure; the UNMIK Kosovo Interim Administration’s,"1; 1 April 2004; 1 July 2002; 1.; 10; 10 June 1999; 10.2; 11; 110.1; 12; 12 December 1999; 14; 15; 15.4; 16; 18; 18 April 2003; 180,816.00; 19; 1966; 1999/2; 2; 2/1999; 20; 2001; 2002; 2003; 21; 22; 22 March 1989; 23; 24; 25 July 1999; 26; 27; 28; 28 February 2003; 3; 30 June 2003; 30 September 2001; 31 July 2000; 4; 4 13; 5; 6; 6 June 2003; 7; 8; 9; 9 July 2003; All Suppliers and Contractors; Article 15; Article 15 1; Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No.; Article 15.1; Article 15.4; Article 4 1; Article 4.1.1; Article 4.3.3; Articles 15.1; First; Pillar II; Pillar IV; Pristina International Airport; Procurement Officer 1; Second tender 17; UNMIK Regulation; Vendor 1; Vendor 1.; Vendor 2; Yugoslavian; at least two; first; one; second; the Charter of the United Nations; the Staff Regulations; the end of June 2002; two",DECEPTIVE PRACTICE,1,"{'doc_id': '8.pdf', 'timestamp': '2025-01-31T23:35:10.846710', 'length': 15051, 'dates': ['28 February 2003', '12 December 1999', '22 March 1989', '2001', '2003', '10 June 1999', '25 July 1999', 'the end of June 2002', 'the end of June 2002', '31 July 2000', '30 September 2001', '1 July 2002', '1 April 2004', '18 April 2003', '18 April 2003', '6 June 2003', 'Second tender 17', '30 June 2003', '9 July 2003', 'Vendor 1', '1966', '2002', 'Vendor 1', 'Vendor 1']}"

The following sets forth the finding s of the Procurement Task Force  concerning United Nations staff me mber Walter Cabrera.         INTRODUCTION      The Procurement Task Force wa s created on January 12, 2006 to  address all procurement matt ers referred to the Office of Internal Oversight  Services (OIOS).  The creation of the Task Force was the result of perceived  problems in procurement identified by the Independent Inquiry Committee  into the Oil for Food Programme (IIC),  and the arrest and conviction of UN  procurement officer Alexander Yakovlev.               Under its Terms of Ref erence, the Task Force operates as part of  OIOS, and reports directly to the Unde r Secretary General of OIOS.   The  remit of the Task Force is to inve stigate all open and pending procurement  cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises,  procurement staff, and vendors doing  business with the United Nations  (hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”).  The mandate of the Task Force also  includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but  it is nevertheless determined that furthe r investigative effort is warranted.      The Task Force’s investigations ha ve also focused upon a myriad of  individuals and vendors doing business w ith the Organization.  Some of  these matters are particularly complex a nd span significant periods of time.   Since its inception, more than 200 matt ers, involving numerous procurement  cases in various UN Missions and UN He adquarters have been referred to  the Task Force.   The Task Force w ill report on matters individually. The  Task Force has given priority to the matters involving the eight staff  members placed on special  leave with pay.       The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit  findings of January 2006 concerning Wa lter Cabrera, a United Nations  procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    2Force through a separate referral.    Fi rst, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have  improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had  been granted in favor of the vendor , Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a  contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official  award of the contract.  Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera  engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in  substantial contracts ultimately awar ded to the firm Telecommunications  Consultants of India (TCIL).  Th e audit report found significant fraud  indicators in connection with the procur ement exercises in these contracts, a  conclusion with which the Task Force agrees.  (The Task Force will report  on these issues in much more detail in  a subsequent report addressing related  matters).  However, the focus of this  report is upon the conduct of Mr.  Cabrera individually, and whether Mr . Cabrera acted improperly in his  participation in these matters.       APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS     This matter is examined within th e confines of the applicable United  Nations regulations and rules, a nd in particular, the following:    Rule 1.2(b) which requires Staff Memb ers to “uphold the highest standards  of efficiency, competence, and integrity.” The regula tions define the concept  of integrity to include, but not limit ed to, “probity, impartiality, fairness,  honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting thei r work and status.”      Rule 1.2(i) which requires that Sta ff members “shall exercise the utmost  discretion with regard to all matters of official business.  They shall not  communicate to any Government, en tity, person or any other source any  information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has been  made public, except as appropriate  in the normal course of their duties or  by authorization of the Secretary- General.”     METHODOLOGY     The Task Force has examined the di scussion and findings in the audit  report, and spoken with both the auditors  responsible for the matter, and, on  several occasions, Mr. Cabrera.  The Ta sk Force has examin ed the file from OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    3the procurement department (“PD”) in connection with the Thunderbird  matter, and the TCIL contracts. Howeve r, substantial portions of the files  concerning both of these cases were f ound to be missing.  Nonetheless, the  Task Force has examined relevant email communication, electronically  stored records, and hard copy documen ts received through a variety of  sources.  The Task Force has spoken w ith the officials in DPKO responsible  for requisition of the items underlying the contracts at issue, and other United Nations procurement officer s involved in these matters.               With regard to the TCIL contracts, the investigation of Mr. Cabrera’s  involvement in the laptop procuremen t, more fully discussed below, has  faced a number of significant ch allenges including the procurement  department’s policy of short term retention of cancelled bids and the  turnover and movement of staff.  Neve rtheless, forensic data recovery has  been an important tool utilized to  examine the circumstances and the  relevant communication on the issue.  In connection with the Thunderbird  matter, significant portions of the Thunderb ird file are also missing.  In that  case as well, the Task Force has been able  to use forensic resources to gather  significant relevant information and evidence.    DISCUSSION      Notice of the Award to Thunderbird LLC      The facts of this matter as they relate to Mr. Cabrera are not in  dispute.  In May, 2002, Thunder bird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr.  Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, ha d submitted an application in support  of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit  proposals on upcoming UN contracts.  In July, 2002, after successfully being  registered by PD, Thunderbird, throug h Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal  for the supply of engineering manpower  to various UN Missions in response  to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department.  Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya  Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the  Headquarters Committee on Contracts (H CC) in favor of the award to  Thunderbird.  The matter had not been  assigned to Mr. Cabrera until late  December, 2002, and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that  time.     OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    4However, after the presentati on by Mr. Bahel to the HCC on 4  September 2002, the HCC granted exped ited approval for an extension of  the existing contract being performed at the time by IECS-IRCON (“IECS”),  and a subsequent award to Thunderbird to replace IECS.  The circumstances  surrounding the request fo r expedited approval and the basis for it are not  fully clear.  There is no record of such  a request, and there is no reference to  any such request in the minutes of th e HCC.    Mr. Cabrera has denied  making the request, and there is no information in the procurement  department’s files on the issue or to suggest Mr. Cabrera made the request.   However, it is clear that the requ est is required to come from the  procurement department, either the o fficer making the presentation, or the  supervisor.  The line officer who atte nded the HCC meeting with Mr. Bahel  has denied making the request at any time, and there is not evidence to  suggest that she did.       However, the investigation ha s revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal  involvement in ensuring that the ve ndor, Thunderbird, received advanced  notice of the likely award.  Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also  the only individual associated with th e request for expedited approval in a  position to seek it.  The need for expe dited approval for Thunderbird in the  first instance and the effort to notify T hunderbird quickly of a likely award is  questionable in light of the fact that  in the same HCC meeting the current  vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two  months, and that Thunderbird had fa iled to submit audited financial  statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task .   (However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms).    Thus, the  basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is  problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application  was still not yet complete.  Curiously , there is no request for advanced  notification to IECS of the exped ited approval of their extension.      While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet  finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting  expedited approval for both  the continuation of the current contractor, and  for the replacement, Thunderbird.  The circumstances surrounding the  creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first  instance are troubling, and are a con tinued subject of the Task Force’s  investigation.  However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    5the Task Force which demons trates Mr. Cabrera particip ated in this aspect of  the matter.    After the HCC presentation, Mr. Ba hel, who was scheduled to leave  New York for annual leave, convened a meeting with Ms. Jane Redfern, a  UN procurement officer, and Mr. Walter Cab rera prior to his departure.  In  this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to  them.  According to Mr. Cabrera,  he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to  Thunderbird, but was able to give ve rbal notification of the HCC’s action  based upon the document issued by the HC C.   Mr. Cabrera’s understanding  that this action was permissible was ba sed upon the fact that his supervisor,  Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at  the time.   At the direction of Mr. Ba hel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr.  Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recomme nded that the contract be awarded  to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird woul d likely receive the contract.   Mr.  Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an  LOI prior to receiving the approved H CC minutes and formal award of the  contract. (Mr. Kohli’s explanation of the events in his written submission to the Organization through his attorney ma terially differs, however the Task  Force does not find Mr. Kohli’s representations credible).       Mr. Cabrera concedes that he pr ovided notice to Nishan Kohli at the  express direction of Mr. Bahel afte r the HCC had issued a notice of  expedited approval.   According to Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Bahel left instructions  to await a copy of the approval in hi s inbox in the procurement office.   Further, according to Mr. Cabrera, Mr . Bahel explained to Mr. Cabrera that  he would be out of the office and reque sted that Mr. Cabrera should retrieve  the document and notify the vendor of  the likely award.  Mr. Cabrera  acknowledges that he followed the direc tion, and in the course of contact  with Mr. Kohli, he pr ovided the notification.   While the salient facts as they relate  to Mr. Cabrera set forth above are  not in dispute, the propriety of his ac tions has been questioned.  The Task  Force has examined whether Mr. Cabrer a’s conduct ran afoul of any relevant  United Nations regulations or rules, particularly the prohibition against  improper communication of propriety information to those outside of the  Organization not authorized to receive it (Regulation 1.2(i)), the prohibitions OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    6against favoring particular vendors in bidding exercises, and the  procurement rules in gene ral.  Mr. Cabrera’s cont ention in defense of his  actions is that in instances in which the HCC grants expedited approval, and  thereafter issues the approval form, no tification to the vendor that an award  is likely does not contravene existing rules.      The Task Force has not been  able to identify any precise  procurement rule on this point in ex istence at this time and requests of  numerous departments in the Organizati on have failed to produce anything  relevant.  Hence, there does not seem  to be any clear directive either  permitting or prohibiting such action.  Fu rther, several witnesses within the  Organization with significant experi ence in procurement matters have  informed the Task Force that in circ umstances in which expedited approval  is sought, it is not improper to provi de such conditional notice to allow a  contractor to prepare to comply with its obligations under the contract and  allow them to adequately prepare themselv es to perform in a timely fashion.    While it is certainly questionable whethe r in this instance notice of expedited  approval was truly exigent in light of the fact that the vendor was not going  to perform under the contract for tw o months and Thunderbird had yet to  submit audited financial statements, th ere is no evidence that suggests Mr.  Cabrera shared responsibility for the re quest in the first instance, or was  otherwise aware of the unexplained circumstances of the request for  expedited approval and the basis for it.      Therefore, in light of the fore going, and the absence of a clear  regulation to the contrary demonstra ting that Mr. Cabrera should have  known his actions were improper, th e notification Mr. Cabrera provided  cannot form the basis of an adverse finding against him.   The TCIL Contracts      The contracts awarded to the firm  Telecommunication Consultants of  India (TCIL) have been the subject of extensive examination by the Task  Force.  Again, while these matters  will be discussed in much more  exhaustive and comprehensive detail in  a subsequent report, they are  addressed herein only as they relate to Mr. Cabrera.     OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    7 The Task Force has exam ined the five contracts set forth in Table 11  of the audit report AP2005/600/20 of Ja nuary 19, 2006, at paragraph 123.   While the Task Force acknowledges that the auditors quite correctly found  that strong indications of fraud existed in connection with these contracts, an  examination of Mr. Cabrera’s role in  these matters has not resulted in  evidence of improper conduct on his part.    The investigation has found that  Mr. Cabrera was not involved in the bidding procedures in these matters, with the exception of one contract.   Wh ile an extensive discussion of all of  these cases is therefore unnecessary, an  analysis of Case #5, PD/155/02, the  laptop computers, requires discussion as  Mr. Cabrera was the case officer.     In this matter, the audit report f ound at paragraph 12 5 that “[t]here  were indications that Walter Cabrera distorted communication to DPKO for  the purpose of canceling the initial bid where TCIL was not the lowest  bidder, and the Compaq brand of co mputers offered by TCIL was not going  to be selected as a standardized bra nd.  TCIL won the replacement bid.”       In addressing this issue, some background is necessary.  First, it  should be noted that the procurement f ile in this matter was found to be  incomplete, missing documents and releva nt information.  The Task Force  was able to identify more details as a re sult of forensic analysis of electronic  media.  However, it cannot be  said that the Task For ce is comfortable that all  information involving this matter has been gathered.  That said, the Task  Force was able to reconstruct the follo wing facts concerning this matter from  various documents and searches of el ectronic media, and discussions with  relevant parties.      In February, 2002, DPKO Communica tions and Technology Services  Division (CITS) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop  computers.  Mr. Cabrera was the proc urement officer in the procurement  department (PD) assigned to this matte r.  The Chief of CITS communicated  his request to PD, and on February 25,  2002 an expression of interest was  issued by PD.   An invitation to bi d followed on April 15, 2002 which was  transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries.                 CITS advised PD th at they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq”  based on ITSD standards for desktop com puters.  On the other hand, PD and  the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    8process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and  NEC to the list.  In a subsequent ex change of emails between PD and the  requisitioner (CITS and IT SD), CITS continued to assert that they sought  only the three major brands of com puters to avoid “inferior products,”  laptops from “questionable manufact urers,” “clones” and “home built  computers.”  Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to  expanding the field to include other ma jor brands of computer manufacturers  who were recognized industry leaders.  As a result, on April 24, 2002, the  case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the  vendors correcting the anticipated qua ntity of the computers sought, and  clarifying that that only “Compaq, De ll, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and  NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation.    On May 15, 2002 the bids were  read publicly.  La Cresta  Communications of California submitted the lowest priced bid based upon a  Pentium III Toshiba model.  TCIL wa s the next lowest bidder offering a  Compaq model, followed by Dell, and then SSDI with  an IBM, and finally  Manchester Technologies offering a Fu jitsu model.  On May 30, 2002, Mr.  Cabrera notified La Cresta that th e company needed to resubmit the  specifications for the Toshiba model th ey were offering as the table of  compliance with the bid technical term s was absent and specification pages  from La Cresta’s submission were contrary to the proper format.   Nevertheless, Mr. Cabrera allowed La Cresta to resubmit the pages.        In its response, La Cresta informed PD that Toshiba was  discontinuing the Pentium III model offered in its original submission, but that they would upgrade the model propos ed to a Pentium IV at no extra cost  to the Organization.  La Cresta in formed PD that because Toshiba was  discontinuing the Pentium III model, they therefore could not provide the anticipated quantity of Pentium III laptops  called for in the RFP.  However,  La Cresta informed PD of its ability to fill the order for the guaranteed  quantity with the currently proposed m odel and of its readiness to fill the  remainder with an upgraded model at no extra cost.               The investigation has re vealed that Mr. Cabrera  forwarded to CITS,  by email, La Cresta’s updated offe r of an upgraded model. Email  communication reflects that Mr. Cabrer a’s dialogue with DPKO continued  with respect to La Cresta’s offe r.  The Task Force has expended OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    9considerable effort to reconstruct the sequence of events that followed. A  three week lapse existed be tween the time of the find ing that La Cresta was  determined to be compliant, and the initi ation of the re-bidding exercise. In  the interim period, email corres pondence confirms that DPKO found  LaCresta to be technically compliant ev en after the offer of an upgrade. Mr.  Cabrera was further in the midst of pr eparing the presentation to the HCC.                  Procurement  Department  officials concede that at this point there  was no further issue and there was no jus tification not to award the contract  to LaCresta.  Indeed, no justification is  provided to La Cresta, or found in  the file.  It seems that La Cresta  was not formally informed of the  cancellation. (Typically the case offi cer maintains the responsibility for  communicating the cancellation to the ve ndor.)  In this case, there is no  correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying  them of the cancellation.  A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversa tions with PD in this interim period,  it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an  “issue” with LaCresta’s submission.  According to the official, the  Procurement Department suggested a re -bid because of a “technicality.”   While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a  commercial one it is only within PD’s  prerogative to cancel the bid on the  basis of commercial non-compliance.  This  explanation is not persuasive as  there was no commercial or technical issu e with LaCresta’s bid.  DPKO had  found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder.  Mr.  Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffe red by PD to the DPKO official is  not sound, but takes issue with a ny claim participation by him in the  exchange or decision.                  Nonetheless, it is clear that a new invitation to bid (ITB) was  issued.  The basis for this renewed ITB however is not clear, nor is the  identity of the individual(s) who s ought it.  The Task Force has not  identified any evidence to support a fi nding that Mr. Cabrera was involved  in the decision and the documents demons trate that Mr. Cabrera continued to  maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerni ng its requests.  Further, the Task  Force has not identified evidence whic h suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to  cancel the bid, and then seek  a re-bidding exercise.    OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    10The investigation has revealed howev er that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor,  Sanjaya Bahel, was intimat ely involved in the matter, and interjected himself  in it, communicating with ITSD offici als and DPKO officials.  The DPKO  official referred to above stated that he had conversations with Mr. Bahel in  which Mr. Bahel confirmed that PD was of the view that there was a  technical issue with LaCresta’s bid,  and there should be a new bidding  exercise.    The proposal was re-bid in early July.  The supplemental ITB  ultimately limited the solicitation to th e three brands requested by CITS.   The ITB was based upon the upgraded speci fications, the Pentium IV model.   Ten companies responded, and two companies, TCIL  and Danoffice, were  the most competitive both offering the same Compaq model. TCIL offered  the lowest price, followed by Danoffice.   Of the initial bidders, TCIL was  the only company to offer a lower price for the computer model it offered.   All other vendors raised their prices fro m the initial bid.  Although La Cresta  offered a Compaq brand, and the s econd lowest bid, the model it was  offering was inferior to the models offered by TCIL and Danoffice, and was  in fact determined by CITS to be non-compliant.    On July 18, 2002, Sanjaya Bahe l, the Officer in Charge of  Procurement at the time, recommended the award to TCIL for a systems  contract in the amount of US$5,340,000.  In the presentation of the matter to  the HCC, officials questioned the basi s for limiting the bidding exercise to  the three specified brands and intimated  that the PD violated UN rules and  regulations by the use of brand names in its ITB. Email communication after  the event describes a circumstance in  which DPKO officials are questioned  about the limitation of the re-solicitati on to the three preferred brands.  The  HCC stated that “were it not for the imminent loss of funds, the Committee  would have recommended that a re-bi dding exercise be conducted inviting  all brands of laptops that met the UN ’s requirement.”  Nevertheless, the  proposed contract award to TCIL wa s ultimately approved, and signed.          The cancellation of the first bid, and the invitation for vendors to  re-submit further bids in light of the cancellation, allowe d the other vendors  a second opportunity to bid on the laptop contract.  While it is unclear what  precipitated this action, the re-bidding ex ercise is questionable in light of the  fact that LaCresta was held to be technically compliant and offered the OIOS  PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE   REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA   STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    11lowest bid.  On that basi s, it appears that they s hould have been awarded the  contract in the absence of objecti on by the requisitioner.  Mr. Cabrera  concedes that this is the case.   Neve rtheless, there is a lack of evidence in  possession of the Task Force that Mr. Ca brera was a factor in causing the re- bidding exercise.  Indeed, he did not have the authority to do it, and past  practice suggests that such a decision could only come from a supervisor.    As such, the Task Force’s investiga tion cannot conclude that Mr. Cabrera  engaged in this act to favor TCIL, not withstanding the fact that cancellation  of the initial bid and the re-bidding exercise allowed TCIL, and the other  vendors, a second opportunity for the contract.      CONCLUSION      Based upon the foregoing, the Task Force’s investigation has been  unable to identify a sufficient basis to support a finding that procurement  officer Walter Cabrera acted in viola tion UN rules and regulations of the  Organization in connection with 1) his involvement in the Thunderbird  matter in 2002, and 2) his participa tion in the TCIL contracts, and in  particular the laptop contract , which were the subject of the audit report.","United Nations Nations Unies OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE This Report is protected und er the provisions of ST/SGB/273, paragraph 18, of 7 September 1994 REPORT ON MR. WALTER CABRERA Report no. PTF-R001/06 Case no. PTF/026/06 STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 19 July 2006OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 1This is a report dealing with the ma tters raised (1) in the audit report dated 26 January 2006 PD/155/02 an d (2) raised in other referrals concerning Mr. Walter Cabrera, pr ocurement officer, Headquarters Procurement Section, at relevant times. The following sets forth the finding s of the Procurement Task Force concerning United Nations staff me mber Walter Cabrera. INTRODUCTION The Procurement Task Force wa s created on January 12, 2006 to address all procurement matt ers referred to the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). The creation of the Task Force was the result of perceived problems in procurement identified by the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil for Food Programme (IIC), and the arrest and conviction of UN procurement officer Alexander Yakovlev. Under its Terms of Ref erence, the Task Force operates as part of OIOS, and reports directly to the Unde r Secretary General of OIOS. The remit of the Task Force is to inve stigate all open and pending procurement cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises, procurement staff, and vendors doing business with the United Nations (hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”). The mandate of the Task Force also includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but it is nevertheless determined that furthe r investigative effort is warranted. The Task Force’s investigations ha ve also focused upon a myriad of individuals and vendors doing business w ith the Organization. Some of these matters are particularly complex a nd span significant periods of time. Since its inception, more than 200 matt ers, involving numerous procurement cases in various UN Missions and UN He adquarters have been referred to the Task Force. The Task Force w ill report on matters individually. The Task Force has given priority to the matters involving the eight staff members placed on special leave with pay. The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit findings of January 2006 concerning Wa lter Cabrera, a United Nations procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2Force through a separate referral. Fi rst, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had been granted in favor of the vendor , Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official award of the contract. Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in substantial contracts ultimately awar ded to the firm Telecommunications Consultants of India (TCIL). Th e audit report found significant fraud indicators in connection with the procur ement exercises in these contracts, a conclusion with which the Task Force agrees. (The Task Force will report on these issues in much more detail in a subsequent report addressing related matters). However, the focus of this report is upon the conduct of Mr. Cabrera individually, and whether Mr . Cabrera acted improperly in his participation in these matters. APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS This matter is examined within th e confines of the applicable United Nations regulations and rules, a nd in particular, the following: Rule 1.2(b) which requires Staff Memb ers to “uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity.” The regula tions define the concept of integrity to include, but not limit ed to, “probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting thei r work and status.” Rule 1.2(i) which requires that Sta ff members “shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of official business. They shall not communicate to any Government, en tity, person or any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position that they know or ought to have known has been made public, except as appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary- General.” METHODOLOGY The Task Force has examined the di scussion and findings in the audit report, and spoken with both the auditors responsible for the matter, and, on several occasions, Mr. Cabrera. The Ta sk Force has examin ed the file from OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3the procurement department (“PD”) in connection with the Thunderbird matter, and the TCIL contracts. Howeve r, substantial portions of the files concerning both of these cases were f ound to be missing. Nonetheless, the Task Force has examined relevant email communication, electronically stored records, and hard copy documen ts received through a variety of sources. The Task Force has spoken w ith the officials in DPKO responsible for requisition of the items underlying the contracts at issue, and other United Nations procurement officer s involved in these matters. With regard to the TCIL contracts, the investigation of Mr. Cabrera’s involvement in the laptop procuremen t, more fully discussed below, has faced a number of significant ch allenges including the procurement department’s policy of short term retention of cancelled bids and the turnover and movement of staff. Neve rtheless, forensic data recovery has been an important tool utilized to examine the circumstances and the relevant communication on the issue. In connection with the Thunderbird matter, significant portions of the Thunderb ird file are also missing. In that case as well, the Task Force has been able to use forensic resources to gather significant relevant information and evidence. DISCUSSION Notice of the Award to Thunderbird LLC The facts of this matter as they relate to Mr. Cabrera are not in dispute. In May, 2002, Thunder bird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr. Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, ha d submitted an application in support of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit proposals on upcoming UN contracts. In July, 2002, after successfully being registered by PD, Thunderbird, throug h Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal for the supply of engineering manpower to various UN Missions in response to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department. Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts (H CC) in favor of the award to Thunderbird. The matter had not been assigned to Mr. Cabrera until late December, 2002, and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that time. OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 4However, after the presentati on by Mr. Bahel to the HCC on 4 September 2002, the HCC granted exped ited approval for an extension of the existing contract being performed at the time by IECS-IRCON (“IECS”), and a subsequent award to Thunderbird to replace IECS. The circumstances surrounding the request fo r expedited approval and the basis for it are not fully clear. There is no record of such a request, and there is no reference to any such request in the minutes of th e HCC. Mr. Cabrera has denied making the request, and there is no information in the procurement department’s files on the issue or to suggest Mr. Cabrera made the request. However, it is clear that the requ est is required to come from the procurement department, either the o fficer making the presentation, or the supervisor. The line officer who atte nded the HCC meeting with Mr. Bahel has denied making the request at any time, and there is not evidence to suggest that she did. However, the investigation ha s revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal involvement in ensuring that the ve ndor, Thunderbird, received advanced notice of the likely award. Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also the only individual associated with th e request for expedited approval in a position to seek it. The need for expe dited approval for Thunderbird in the first instance and the effort to notify T hunderbird quickly of a likely award is questionable in light of the fact that in the same HCC meeting the current vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two months, and that Thunderbird had fa iled to submit audited financial statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task . (However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms). Thus, the basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application was still not yet complete. Curiously , there is no request for advanced notification to IECS of the exped ited approval of their extension. While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contractor, and for the replacement, Thunderbird. The circumstances surrounding the creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first instance are troubling, and are a con tinued subject of the Task Force’s investigation. However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5the Task Force which demons trates Mr. Cabrera particip ated in this aspect of the matter. After the HCC presentation, Mr. Ba hel, who was scheduled to leave New York for annual leave, convened a meeting with Ms. Jane Redfern, a UN procurement officer, and Mr. Walter Cab rera prior to his departure. In this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to them. According to Mr. Cabrera, he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Thunderbird, but was able to give ve rbal notification of the HCC’s action based upon the document issued by the HC C. Mr. Cabrera’s understanding that this action was permissible was ba sed upon the fact that his supervisor, Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at the time. At the direction of Mr. Ba hel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr. Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recomme nded that the contract be awarded to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird woul d likely receive the contract. Mr. Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an LOI prior to receiving the approved H CC minutes and formal award of the contract. (Mr. Kohli’s explanation of the events in his written submission to the Organization through his attorney ma terially differs, however the Task Force does not find Mr. Kohli’s representations credible). Mr. Cabrera concedes that he pr ovided notice to Nishan Kohli at the express direction of Mr. Bahel afte r the HCC had issued a notice of expedited approval. According to Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Bahel left instructions to await a copy of the approval in hi s inbox in the procurement office. Further, according to Mr. Cabrera, Mr . Bahel explained to Mr. Cabrera that he would be out of the office and reque sted that Mr. Cabrera should retrieve the document and notify the vendor of the likely award. Mr. Cabrera acknowledges that he followed the direc tion, and in the course of contact with Mr. Kohli, he pr ovided the notification. While the salient facts as they relate to Mr. Cabrera set forth above are not in dispute, the propriety of his ac tions has been questioned. The Task Force has examined whether Mr. Cabrer a’s conduct ran afoul of any relevant United Nations regulations or rules, particularly the prohibition against improper communication of propriety information to those outside of the Organization not authorized to receive it (Regulation 1.2(i)), the prohibitions OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 6against favoring particular vendors in bidding exercises, and the procurement rules in gene ral. Mr. Cabrera’s cont ention in defense of his actions is that in instances in which the HCC grants expedited approval, and thereafter issues the approval form, no tification to the vendor that an award is likely does not contravene existing rules. The Task Force has not been able to identify any precise procurement rule on this point in ex istence at this time and requests of numerous departments in the Organizati on have failed to produce anything relevant. Hence, there does not seem to be any clear directive either permitting or prohibiting such action. Fu rther, several witnesses within the Organization with significant experi ence in procurement matters have informed the Task Force that in circ umstances in which expedited approval is sought, it is not improper to provi de such conditional notice to allow a contractor to prepare to comply with its obligations under the contract and allow them to adequately prepare themselv es to perform in a timely fashion. While it is certainly questionable whethe r in this instance notice of expedited approval was truly exigent in light of the fact that the vendor was not going to perform under the contract for tw o months and Thunderbird had yet to submit audited financial statements, th ere is no evidence that suggests Mr. Cabrera shared responsibility for the re quest in the first instance, or was otherwise aware of the unexplained circumstances of the request for expedited approval and the basis for it. Therefore, in light of the fore going, and the absence of a clear regulation to the contrary demonstra ting that Mr. Cabrera should have known his actions were improper, th e notification Mr. Cabrera provided cannot form the basis of an adverse finding against him. The TCIL Contracts The contracts awarded to the firm Telecommunication Consultants of India (TCIL) have been the subject of extensive examination by the Task Force. Again, while these matters will be discussed in much more exhaustive and comprehensive detail in a subsequent report, they are addressed herein only as they relate to Mr. Cabrera. OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 7 The Task Force has exam ined the five contracts set forth in Table 11 of the audit report AP2005/600/20 of Ja nuary 19, 2006, at paragraph 123. While the Task Force acknowledges that the auditors quite correctly found that strong indications of fraud existed in connection with these contracts, an examination of Mr. Cabrera’s role in these matters has not resulted in evidence of improper conduct on his part. The investigation has found that Mr. Cabrera was not involved in the bidding procedures in these matters, with the exception of one contract. Wh ile an extensive discussion of all of these cases is therefore unnecessary, an analysis of Case #5, PD/155/02, the laptop computers, requires discussion as Mr. Cabrera was the case officer. In this matter, the audit report f ound at paragraph 12 5 that “[t]here were indications that Walter Cabrera distorted communication to DPKO for the purpose of canceling the initial bid where TCIL was not the lowest bidder, and the Compaq brand of co mputers offered by TCIL was not going to be selected as a standardized bra nd. TCIL won the replacement bid.” In addressing this issue, some background is necessary. First, it should be noted that the procurement f ile in this matter was found to be incomplete, missing documents and releva nt information. The Task Force was able to identify more details as a re sult of forensic analysis of electronic media. However, it cannot be said that the Task For ce is comfortable that all information involving this matter has been gathered. That said, the Task Force was able to reconstruct the follo wing facts concerning this matter from various documents and searches of el ectronic media, and discussions with relevant parties. In February, 2002, DPKO Communica tions and Technology Services Division (CITS) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop computers. Mr. Cabrera was the proc urement officer in the procurement department (PD) assigned to this matte r. The Chief of CITS communicated his request to PD, and on February 25, 2002 an expression of interest was issued by PD. An invitation to bi d followed on April 15, 2002 which was transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries. CITS advised PD th at they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq” based on ITSD standards for desktop com puters. On the other hand, PD and the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 8process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC to the list. In a subsequent ex change of emails between PD and the requisitioner (CITS and IT SD), CITS continued to assert that they sought only the three major brands of com puters to avoid “inferior products,” laptops from “questionable manufact urers,” “clones” and “home built computers.” Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other ma jor brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized industry leaders. As a result, on April 24, 2002, the case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated qua ntity of the computers sought, and clarifying that that only “Compaq, De ll, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation. On May 15, 2002 the bids were read publicly. La Cresta Communications of California submitted the lowest priced bid based upon a Pentium III Toshiba model. TCIL wa s the next lowest bidder offering a Compaq model, followed by Dell, and then SSDI with an IBM, and finally Manchester Technologies offering a Fu jitsu model. On May 30, 2002, Mr. Cabrera notified La Cresta that th e company needed to resubmit the specifications for the Toshiba model th ey were offering as the table of compliance with the bid technical term s was absent and specification pages from La Cresta’s submission were contrary to the proper format. Nevertheless, Mr. Cabrera allowed La Cresta to resubmit the pages. In its response, La Cresta informed PD that Toshiba was discontinuing the Pentium III model offered in its original submission, but that they would upgrade the model propos ed to a Pentium IV at no extra cost to the Organization. La Cresta in formed PD that because Toshiba was discontinuing the Pentium III model, they therefore could not provide the anticipated quantity of Pentium III laptops called for in the RFP. However, La Cresta informed PD of its ability to fill the order for the guaranteed quantity with the currently proposed m odel and of its readiness to fill the remainder with an upgraded model at no extra cost. The investigation has re vealed that Mr. Cabrera forwarded to CITS, by email, La Cresta’s updated offe r of an upgraded model. Email communication reflects that Mr. Cabrer a’s dialogue with DPKO continued with respect to La Cresta’s offe r. The Task Force has expended OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 9considerable effort to reconstruct the sequence of events that followed. A three week lapse existed be tween the time of the find ing that La Cresta was determined to be compliant, and the initi ation of the re-bidding exercise. In the interim period, email corres pondence confirms that DPKO found LaCresta to be technically compliant ev en after the offer of an upgrade. Mr. Cabrera was further in the midst of pr eparing the presentation to the HCC. Procurement Department officials concede that at this point there was no further issue and there was no jus tification not to award the contract to LaCresta. Indeed, no justification is provided to La Cresta, or found in the file. It seems that La Cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation. (Typically the case offi cer maintains the responsibility for communicating the cancellation to the ve ndor.) In this case, there is no correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation. A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversa tions with PD in this interim period, it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an “issue” with LaCresta’s submission.

This explanation is not persuasive as there was no commercial or technical issu e with LaCresta’s bid. DPKO had found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder. Mr. Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffe red by PD to the DPKO official is not sound, but takes issue with a ny claim participation by him in the exchange or decision. Nonetheless, it is clear that a new invitation to bid (ITB) was issued. The basis for this renewed ITB however is not clear, nor is the identity of the individual(s) who s ought it. The Task Force has not identified any evidence to support a fi nding that Mr. Cabrera was involved in the decision and the documents demons trate that Mr. Cabrera continued to maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerni ng its requests. Further, the Task Force has not identified evidence whic h suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to cancel the bid, and then seek a re-bidding exercise. OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE REPORT ON WALTER CABRERA STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 10The investigation has revealed howev er that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor, Sanjaya Bahel, was intimat ely involved in the matter, and interjected himself in it, communicating with ITSD offici als and DPKO officials.

CONCLUSION Based upon the foregoing, the Task Force’s investigation has been unable to identify a sufficient basis to support a finding that procurement officer Walter Cabrera acted in viola tion UN rules and regulations of the Organization in connection with 1) his involvement in the Thunderbird matter in 2002, and 2) his participa tion in the TCIL contracts, and in particular the laptop contract , which were the subject of the audit report.",California; Communica; Compaq; New York; Organizati; PD; ny; the Thunderb ird,Alexander Yakovlev; Ba hel; Bahel; Ca brera; Cabrer; Cabrera; DISCUSSION Notice of the Award to Thunderbird LLC; Fu rther; Jane Redfern; Kohli; La Cresta; La Cresta’s; LaCresta; Neve; Nishan Kohli; Sanjaya Bahe l; Sanjaya Bahel; The Ta sk Force; WALTER CABRERA; Wa lter Cabrera; Walter Cab; Walter Cabrera; atte nded; awar ded; ma; ma jor; matt ers,"CITS; Committee; Compaq; DPKO; Danoffice; De ll; Dell; Field Procurement; Fujitsu; HCC; Headquarters Procurement Section; IBM; IECS; IECS-IRCON; ITB; Ja nuary 19, 2006; LOI; La Cresta; La Cresta Communications; La Cresta’s; LaCresta; Manchester Technologies; NEC; OIOS; OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE; Organization; PD; PD/155/02; Pentium III; Pentium IV; Procurement Department; RFP; Sony; TCIL; Technology Services Division; Telecommunication Consultants of India; Telecommunications Consultants of India; The Task Force; The Task Force’s; Thunder bird LLC; Thunderbird LLC; Toshiba; UN; UN Missions; Unde; United Nations; United Nations Nations Unies OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE This Report; ac; el ectronic; fa; follo; pr ocurement; provi de; the Headquarters Committee on Contracts (H CC; the Independent Inquiry Committee; the Information Technology Services Division; the OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE; the Office of Internal Oversight Services; the Oil for Food Programme; the Procurement Department; the Task For ce; the Task Force; the Task Force’s; the Task OIOS PROCUREMENT TASK FORCE; the United Nations; the direc tion; the procurement department; the procurement department’s; thei r","1; 12 5; 123; 18; 2; 2002; 26 January 2006; 36; 4 September 2002; 4However; 5,340,000; 7 September 1994; April 15, 2002; April 24, 2002; CITS; February 25, 2002; February, 2002; First; Fu; January 12, 2006; January 2006; July 18, 2002; July, 2002; May 15, 2002; May 30, 2002; May, 2002; Pentium III; Pentium III Toshiba; Secondly; Sta ff; TCIL; Table 11; Ten; Thunderbird; an additional four weeks; an additional two months; annual; basi s; early July; eight; eight weeks; first; five; late December, 2002; more than 200; nine; one; r.; second; the minutes; the minutes of th e HCC; three; three week; tw o months; two",DECEPTIVE PRACTICE,0.999,"{'doc_id': '82.pdf', 'timestamp': '2025-01-31T23:35:11.696668', 'length': 26948, 'dates': ['7 September 1994', '26 January 2006', 'January 12, 2006', 'January 2006', 'May, 2002', 'July, 2002', 'late December, 2002', '4However', '4 September 2002', 'an additional two months', 'an additional four weeks', 'eight weeks', 'annual', 'tw o months', '12 5', 'February, 2002', 'February 25, 2002', 'April 15, 2002', 'April 24, 2002', 'May 15, 2002', 'May 30, 2002', 'three week', 'early July', 'July 18, 2002', '2002']}"

Vimont conveyed that the French President will express his frustration that Washington has backed away from its proposed bilateral intelligence cooperation agreement and Sarkozy intends to continue to push for closure. As Vimont and Levitte understand it, the main sticking point is the U.S. desire to continue spying on France. On the topic of Afghanistan, Levitte noted that Sarkozy is ready to authorize more military trainers but wants clarification on how many are needed, given the conflicting figures from U.S. sources. Another proposed topic was efforts by the European Aeronautic, Defense, and Space Corporation (EADS) to win a tanker aircraft contract with the U.S. military. Vimont revealed cryptically that the deal is moving forward but did not provide any details. Levitte had not expected to put the labeling dispute with Pernod Ricard (the world's second largest spirits group) on the agenda, but Sarkozy had just spoken to the company's chairman who had asked the president to intercede on his behalf. (COMMENT: Patrick Ricard, chairman of the Pernod Ricard board of directors, is said to be one of Sarkozy's wealthy backers.) Vimont characterized the issue as a very political matter in the U.S., and suggested that a direct appeal to the White House might be useful. While Sarkozy intends to broach the issue with the U.S. President, Levitte will talk to the U.S. President's Economic Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser.

INTRODUCTION    1. This case arises out of an audit report dated 28  February 2003 into the financial  statements of Pristina International Airport conduc ted by the Chartered  Accountants which led to an investigation concernin g alleged corruption and  irregularities arising in the course of procurement s and contracts at Pristina  International Airport.    2. It is alleged that a single source contract for one container was added one month  after a main contract for the supply of two new con tainers and the dismantling,  transport and re-construction of a further seven co ntainers at Pristina Airport.      II. METHODOLOGY    3. This investigation was conducted pursuant to Exe cutive Decision No 2003/16 on  the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators  conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by  interviews with persons  indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations; by  obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport admin istration and from Pillar IV,  which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand.      III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION    4. Pristina International Airport constitutes a sta te owned enterprise under  Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal  buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equi pment. During the period  covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003 , they were maintained by the  Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in coope ration with Military Units of the  Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Sec urity Council Resolution  1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/ 1999 dated 25 July 1999.  UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Ko sovo, including state owned  and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina I nternational Airport.    5. On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the admin istration of the Airport passed  from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and  Pillar IV. The KTA Divisional  Manager was appointed to the Airport Sector, KTA at  the same time. Under him       2    were the PEAP Official and the ACTS Official.    6. On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been  under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction, under  ICAO regulations.    7. It is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to  the following contract have been examined.    IV. INVESTIGATION DETAILS     8. This investigation relates to a Contract, for th e supply of two new containers and  the dismantling, transport and re- construction of a further seven containers at  Pristina Airport. It also deals with a further sing le source contract for the supply of  a further container. The value of the contract is € 24,762 and the supplementary  contract €4,100.    9. It is alleged that there were irregularities in the addition of a single source  contract one month after the award of the main cont ract. In addition, there did not  appear to be any capital expenditure approval or pa yment order on file.    10. Evidence contained in a bid evaluation report d ated 29 August 2002 indicates  that a competitive tender was held on 29 August 200 2 for the supply of two new  containers and the dismantling, transport and re-co nstruction of a further seven  containers at Pristina Airport.     11. Following a competitive tender, the contract wa s awarded to the Vendor who  submitted the lowest bid in the sum of €24,762. A c ontract was signed with the  company on 29 August 2002.     12. On 4 September 2002, a further single source co ntract was signed by the KTA  Divisional Manager for the supply of an additional container. This appears to  have resulted from a direct request from KFOR signe d by the KFOR Official of Air  Movements, dated 3 September 2002, which is attache d to the justification for the  single source contract.     13. The tender file does not contain either a justi fication memorandum or financial  approval documents for the main contract and those documents have not been  locate by the ITF.    V. CONCLUSIONS     14. A competitive tender appears to have been corre ctly held for the main contract  and the addition of the single source contract to a dd a further container appears  to be justified. However, there is an absence of pr oper records detailing events  that gave rise to the competitive tender, together with an absence of documents  confirming that financial approval was sought.    15.
